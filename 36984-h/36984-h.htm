<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Tradition in the sphere of books is relentlessly
imperious and will not be denied.
The present anthology of one-act
plays, in defiance of a keen reluctance
on the part of the editors, is condemned
at birth to the heritage of a title; for
this practice, as is well known, has been
the unchallenged punctilio of book-making
and book-editing from time immemorial.
And yet if the truth be told,
the editors have found precisely this to
be by far the most embarrassing of the
various tasks that have arisen in connection
with the project. In the selection of a
title, the immediate problem was of course
to avoid, so far as possible, the slightest
pretense or assumption of categorical
standards of choice or even the merest
intimation that there existed somewhere,
attainable or unattainable, an ideal norm
according to which one-act plays could
be faultlessly assessed and pigeon-holed.</p>

<p>In point of fact, so many tolerably
good one-act plays are being written and
acted nowadays, that the editors early
concluded that the business of editing
a volume of fifty one-act pieces implies,
so to speak, inviting the devil or the
spirit that denies to the feast. Thus all
manner of obstinate ribaldries and mischief
began to infest our path of progress.</p>

<p>If it were only a na&iuml;ve question
of adjudging a golden apple to one of
three lovely women, earthly or divine,
the matter would have proved comparatively
simple; but the question was more
complex: it offered the public a meager
book which could never hope to compress
within itself the core and quiddity
of about a thousand plays, or
more, which the editors were privileged
to examine from the first moment when
they launched upon their task eight
months ago, to this. Moreover it frequently
happened that when the editors
had flattered themselves on having picked
a sure winner, the sure winner forthwith
got out of hand and no persuasive cajolings
availed to allure it back. In
other words, not a few plays which the
editors sought to include in the book
were found unavailable by reason of
previous copyrights. In several cases
the copyright had passed entirely out of
the control of the author or his accredited
representative.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, both authors
and those commissioned to act for them
have responded most sympathetically to
the project and have rendered valuable
assistance and support, without which,
let me hasten to add, the present collection
would not have been possible.</p>

<p>The reader will observe that plays by
American authors predominate over
those of any other single country, and
the reason for this is fairly obvious.
American plays, besides being most readily
available to the anthologist, are beginning
to reflect the renascence that is
gradually taking place in the American
theater. There is growing up in this
country a younger generation of dramatists,
which is achieving its most notable
work outside the beaten path of
popular recognition, in small dramatic
juntos and in the little theaters. In
the main, the form they employ as being
most suitable to their needs, is that offered
by the concise scaffold of the one-act
play. These efforts, we hold, deserve
a wider audience.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a mere scrutiny of
the table of contents will reveal that
the editors have included a number of
foreign plays heretofore not accessible to
English-speaking readers. This aspect
of the task, the effort of pioneer exploration,
has indeed been by far the
most pleasant, and most pleasant, too,
has proved the discovery of several new
American writers who have produced
original work. Of the foreign writers,
such men as Wied and Speenhof, for example,
are practically if not totally unknown
to American readers, and they, as
well as a handful of others, are in the
opinion of the editors worthy of an
American following.</p>

<p>As concerns the procedure or technic
of choice, it goes without saying, surely,
that if a congruous method exists at all,
it merely embodies a certain permissible
viewpoint. This viewpoint will probably
find unqualified favor with but a
handful of readers; others it will frankly
outrage to the extent of their casting it
out, lock, stock and barrel. But this is
to be looked for in an undertaking of this
caliber in which individual bias, after all,
plays so leading a part. And titling the
volume came to be an arduous process
only in virtue of the afore-mentioned
viewpoint, cherished but shadowily defined,
or to be exact, in virtue of the
despair which succeeded upon each persistent
attempt to capture what remained
perennially elusive. Unfortunately it
still remains elusive. If then a rationalization
is demanded by the reader&mdash;a
privilege none will question his right to
exercise&mdash;he will, I am afraid, have to
content himself with something as vague
and fantastic as the following:</p>

<p>Imagine a playhouse, perfectly
equipped, plastic and infinitely adaptable.
Invite Arthur Hopkins, John Williams,
Winthrop Ames, Sam Hume and
George Cram Cook to manage it; let
them run riot on the stage. Clear the
wings and the front of the house of all
routineers. Fill the seats at each performance
with the usual gallery-haunters
of the New York theaters. Do not overlook
the hosts of experimental playhouse
directors&mdash;unleash them in the backyard
area with a <i>kammerspielhaus</i> to toy with
at pleasure. Let the personnel of the
play-reading committee consist of such
men as Ludwig Lewisohn, Barrett H.
Clark, George Jean Nathan and Francis
Hackett. The result will take care of itself.
This, in brief, is the theatrical
m&eacute;nage for which, in the main, the plays
included in this volume were written.</p>

<p>Is this a hair-brained or a frivolous
notion? It may be. But, please note, it
expresses, no matter how limpingly, some
approach to a viewpoint. At all events
it is the only touchstone applied by the
editors in their choice of fifty contemporary
one-act plays.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The garden of a somber Lombardian
Palace. To the right the wall of
a house, which is at an angle with the
moderately high garden wall that encloses
it. The lower portion of the house is
built of rough granite, above which rests
a strip of plain marble forming a sill,
which, under each window, is adorned
with a lion's head in repose. Two windows
are visible, each one having a small
angular balcony with a stone railing,
spaced sufficiently to show the feet of
those standing there. Both windows are
curtained to the floor. The garden is a
mere lawn with a few scattered fruit
trees. The corner of the garden between
the wall and the house is crowded with
high box wood bushes. A leafy grapevine,
trained over stunted chestnut trees,
forms an arbor which completely fills the
left side of the stage; only this entrance
is visible. The arbor slants irregularly
to the left rear. Behind the rear wall
there may be seen (by the gallery spectator)
a narrow path beyond which is
the neighbor's garden wall&mdash;no house is
visible. In the neighbor's garden and as
far as the eye can reach, the tops of the
trees are illuminated by the evening glow
of a brilliant sunset.</i>]</p>

<p class="noidt">A harvester I see, and not the last,<br />
No, not the last, descending from the hill.<br />
There are three more, and there, and there!<br />
Have you no end, you never-ending day?<br />
How have I dragged the hours away from you,<br />
Torn them to shreds and cast them in the flood,<br />
As I do now with these poor tattered blooms!<br />
How have I coaxed each minute of this day.<br />
Each bracelet, and each earring was clasped on,<br />
Ta'en off again, then once more tried, until<br />
'Twas thrown aside, exchanged, and others brought&mdash;<br />
I slowly dripped the fountain, drop on drop<br />
All through my tresses, dried them languidly;<br />
With quiet, measured step, out in the sun<br />
I walked me to and fro&mdash;oh! to and fro!<br />
But 'twas still damp&mdash;the path is narrow there.<br />
I looked among the bushes, for the birds,&mdash;<br />
Less than a zephyr's breath I bent them back,<br />
Those swaying branches, sat 'neath rustling trees,<br />
And felt on cheeks and hands in waiting woe<br />
The little flickerings of warm sunshine.<br />
I closed my eyes, and almost thought soft lips<br />
Gently caressing, strayed my clammy brow.<br />
Sometimes hours come when this duplicity,<br />
All this concealment, seems so fruitless, and<br />
I cannot bear it. I can only gaze<br />
With eyes of steel far up into the sky<br />
Where flocks of wild geese float, or bend me low<br />
O'er some mad, rushing plunging waterfall<br />
That tears my weakling shadow with its flow,&mdash;<br />
I will be patient&mdash;why, I must, I am!&mdash;<br />
Madonna&mdash;I will climb the steepest mount<br />
And on my knees will count me every stone<br />
With this, my rosary, if only now,<br />
Oh, soon,&mdash;this day will sink into the night.<br />
It is so long! I have its measured tread<br />
With these same beads been scanning o'er and o'er.<br />
And now I talk so fev'rishly, instead<br />
Of counting all the leaves upon that tree.<br />
Oh! I have finished much too soon again.<br />
See! See the yeoman, calling to his dog.<br />
The shadows do upon his garden fall,<br />
For him the night has come, but brings no joy;<br />
He fears it, locks his door and is alone.&mdash;<br />
See where the maidens wander to the well.<br />
I know the manner in which each of them<br />
Will fill her bucket&mdash;that one's prettiest.<br />
Why does the stranger at the cross roads stay?<br />
Distant's his goal, I warrant. He unwinds<br />
And folds again the cloth about his feet.<br />
What an existence! Draw the thorns, yes, draw<br />
Them quickly out. You must speed. We all<br />
Must hurry on, the restless day must down<br />
And with it take this bright and scarlet glow<br />
That's lingering in radiance on my cheeks.<br />
All that is troubling us cast far away,<br />
Fling wide the thorn into the field<br />
Where waters flow and sheaves of brilliant flow'rs<br />
Are bending, glowing, yearning towards the night.&mdash;<br />
I draw my rings from off my fingers, and<br />
They're happy as the naked children are<br />
Who scamper quickly to the brook to bathe.&mdash;<br />
Now all the girls have gone&mdash;<br />
Only one maiden's left. Oh, what lovely hair!<br />
I wonder if she knows its beauty's power?<br />
Perhaps she's vain&mdash;but vanity, thou art<br />
A plaything only for the empty years.<br />
When once she has arrived where I am now,<br />
She'll love her hair, she'll let it clasp her close,<br />
Enwrap her round and whisper to her low,<br />
Like echoing harpstrings throbbing with the touch<br />
Of fev'rish fingers straying in the dark.<br />

What, would you close to me? Down, down with you.&mdash;<br />
I bid you greet him. When the dusk has come,<br />
And when his hands hold fast the ladder there<br />
A-sudden he will feel, instead the leaves,<br />
The cool, firm leaves, a gently spraying rain,<br />
A rain that falls at eve from golden clouds.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She lets her hair fall over the balustrade.</i>]</p>

Ah! there's a spider! No, I will not fling<br />
You off; I lay my hand once more<br />
Upon this spot, so you may find again<br />
The road you wish to speed so quickly on.<br />
How I have changed! I am bewitched indeed!<br />
In former days, I could not touch the fruit<br />
Within a basket, if upon its edge<br />
A spider had been seen. Now in my hand<br />
It runs.&mdash;Intoxication makes me glad!<br />
Why, I could walk along the very edge<br />
Of narrow walls, and would not totter&mdash;no!&mdash;<br />
Could I but fall into the waters deep!<br />
In their cool velvet arms I would be well,<br />
Sliding in grottoes of bright sapphire hues<br />
Playing with wondrous beings of the deep<br />
All golden finned, with eyes benignly sad.<br />
Yes, if I were immured in the chestnut woods<br />
Within some ruined walls, my soul were free.<br />
For there the forest's animals would come<br />
And tiny birds. The little weasels would<br />
Brush up against and touch my naked toes<br />
With their soft snouts and lashes of bright eyes<br />
While in the moss I lay and ate wild fruit.&mdash;<br />
What's rustling? 'Tis the little porcupine<br />
Of that first night. What, are you there again,<br />
Stepped from the dark? Art going on the hunt?<br />
Oh! If my hunter would but come to me!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Looking up.</i>]</p>

<p class="noidt">
Now have the shadows vanished! Gone are all<br />
Those of the pines and those of the dolls,<br />
The ones that played about the little huts,<br />
The large ones from the vineyards and the one<br />
Upon the figtree at the crossroads&mdash;gone<br />
As though the quiet earth had sucked them in!<br />
The night has really come! The lamp<br />
Is placed upon the table, closely press<br />
The sheep together&mdash;close within the fold.<br />
Within the darkest corners of the eaves<br />
Where the dustvine-leaves meet, goblins do crouch,<br />
And on the heights from out the clearing step<br />
The blessed saints to gaze where churches stand<br />
Well pleased at seeing chapels manifold.<br />
Now, sweetest plaything, you may also come,<br />
Finer than spider's web, stronger than steel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> What horse did it, I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> The big roan, gracious Lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> Yes, yes, I remember. It
was on the day of Francesco Chieregati's

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse</span> [<i>looks at her</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> I was thinking of something

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Don't you remember, gracious one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> He spoke about it at table.
But I could not hear it. Messer Palla
degli Albizzi sat next to me, and was so
merry, and everybody laughed, so I could
not hear just what my husband said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> When our gracious lord came
to the stall, the roan put back his ears,
foamed with rage and suddenly snapped
at the master's hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Then the master hit the roan
behind the ears with his fist so that the
big, strong horse staggered back as
though it were a dog&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora</span> [<i>is silent, looks dreamily

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Oh, our gracious lord is

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> Yes, indeed. [<i>Attentively

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Our master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> Ah! our master. [<i>Smiles.</i>]&mdash;and
his voice is so beautiful, and that
is why everybody loves to listen to him
in the large, dark church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Listen to whom, gracious one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> To the Spanish monk, to whom else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> No, my Lady, it isn't because
of his voice that people listen to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora</span> [<i>is again not listening</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Gracious one&mdash;my Lady&mdash;is
it true&mdash;what people say about the envoy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> What envoy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> The envoy whom the people
of Como sent to our master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> What are people saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> They say a shepherd saw it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dianora.</span> What did he see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> Our gracious lord was angry
at the envoy&mdash;would not accept the letter
that the people of Como had written
him. Then he took it anyhow&mdash;the letter&mdash;read
part of it, tore it into bits
and held the pieces before the envoy's
mouth and demanded that he swallow
them. But the envoy went backwards,
like a crab, and made stary eyes just
like a crab, and everybody laughed, especially
Signor Silvio, the master's
brother. Then the master sent for the
envoy's mule and had it brought to the
gates. When the envoy was too slow
in mounting, the master whistled for the
dogs. The envoy left with his two yeomen.
Our master went hunting with
seven men and all the dogs. Towards
evening, however, they say that our gracious
lord, and the envoy met at the
bridge over the Adda, there where Verese
begins&mdash;our master and the envoy met.
And the shepherd was passing and drove
his sheep next to the bridge into a wheat-field&mdash;so
that the horses would not kill
them. And the shepherd heard our master
cry, "There's the one who wouldn't
eat, perhaps he'd like to drink." So four
of our men seized the two yeomen, two
others took the envoy, each one took hold
of a leg, lifted him from the saddle&mdash;threw
him screaming like a madman and
struggling fiercely, over the parapet&mdash;he
tore out a piece of the sleeve of one,
together with the flesh. The Adda has
very steep banks at that place&mdash;the river
was dark and swollen from all the snow
on the mountains. The envoy did not appear
again, said the shepherd.</p>

<p class="noidt">I have no children. My mother I saw once&mdash;<br />
I saw her once, just before she died.<br />
My father led me and my sister to<br />
A vaulted, high, severe and gloomy room.<br />
The suff'rer I saw not; her hand alone<br />
Hung like a greeting to me&mdash;that I kissed.<br />
About my father I remember this.<br />
He wore an armor of green burnished gold<br />
With darker clasps&mdash;two always helped him mount<br />
Upon his horse, for he was very old&mdash;<br />
I hardly knew Medea. Not much joy,<br />
Had she, my sister. Thin of hair,<br />
Her forehead and her temples older seemed,<br />
Much older, than her mouth and her hands to me&mdash;<br />
She always held a flower in her hand.&mdash;<br />
O Lord, have mercy unto these sweet souls<br />
As unto mine, and bid them welcome me,<br />

<p class="noidt">In Bergamo where I was taught to walk<br />
Upon the path that brought me here, I was<br />
Often&mdash;most frequently through pride,&mdash;and now<br />
I am contrite and would go to confession<br />
For all those errors, and some graver ones;&mdash;<br />
When I [<i>She ponders.</i>]&mdash;three days after Saint Magdalen<br />
Was riding homeward from the chase with him.<br />
This man, here, who's my husband&mdash;others too&mdash;<br />
Upon the bridge an old lame beggar lay.<br />
I knew that he was old and ill and sore<br />
And there was something in his tired eyes<br />
Reminded me of my dead father&mdash;but<br />
Nevertheless&mdash;only because the one<br />
Riding beside me touched my horse's bridle,<br />
I did not pull aside, but let the dust<br />
My horse kicked up, blind, choke that poor old man.<br />
Yes, so close I rode that with his hands<br />
He had to lift aside his injured leg.<br />
This I remember, this I now regret.<br />

Up to your shoulders&mdash;<br />

Once may a woman be&mdash;yes, once she may<br />
Be as I was for twelve weeks&mdash;once she may be<br />

All veiled, protected by her own great pride<br />

I'm not of these&mdash;that surely you must know.<br />

<p class="noidt">
That day&mdash;'twas in July, Saint Magdalen<br />
Francesco Chieregati's wedding day&mdash;<br />
That nasty thing upon your hand came then,<br />
Came on that day. Well, I remember too<br />
We dined out in the arbor&mdash;near the lake,<br />
And he sat next to me, while opposite<br />
Your brother sat. Then passing me the fruit,<br />
Palla did hold the heavy gold dish<br />
Of luscious peaches so that I might take.<br />
My eyes were fastened on his hands&mdash;I longed<br />
To humbly kiss his hands, there,&mdash;before all.<br />
Your brother&mdash;he's malicious and no fool&mdash;<br />
Caught this my glance, and must have guessed my thought.<br />
He paled with anger.&mdash;Sudden came a dog,<br />
A tall dark greyhound brushed his slender head<br />
Against my hand&mdash;the left one by my side,&mdash;<br />
Your stupid brother kicked in furious rage<br />
With all his might, the dog&mdash;only because<br />
He could not with a shining dagger pierce<br />
Me and my lover. I but looked at him.<br />
Caressed and stroked the dog, and had to laugh<br />

Ecstatically? I could look at you<br />

Filled with the sunlight dancing toward me,<br />

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>Moderately well, but quite
inexpensively furnished apartments occupied
by Margaret. A small fireplace, a
table, a small escritoire, a settee, a wardrobe
cabinet, two windows in the back,
entrances left and right.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, Clement, dressed
in a modish, tarnished-gray sack suit, is
discovered reclining in a fauteuil near
the fireplace. He is smoking a cigarette
and perusing a newspaper. Margaret
is standing at the window. She walks
back and forth, finally goes up directly
behind Clement, and playfully musses
his hair. Evidently she has something
troublesome on her mind.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> [<i>reading, seizes her hand and
kisses it</i>]. Horner's certain about his
pick and doubly certain about mine;
Waterloo five to one; Barometer twenty-one
to one; Busserl seven to one; Attila
sixteen to one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Sixteen to one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Lord Byron one and one-half
to one&mdash;that's us, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Besides, it's sixteen weeks yet
to the Handicap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Evidently he looks upon it as
a clean "runaway."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Not quite&mdash;but where did you
pick up your turf-lingo, Brava?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, I used this kind of talk
before I knew you. Is it settled that
you are to ride Lord Byron yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> How absurd to ask! You forget,
it's the Damenpreis Handicap.
Whom else could I get to ride him?
And if Horner thought for a moment
that I wasn't going to ride him, he'd
never put up one and a half to one. You
may stake all you've got on that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I'm well aware of that. You
are <i>so</i> handsome when you mount a horse&mdash;honest
and truly, too sweet for anything!
I shall never forget that day in
Munich, when I first made your acquaintance&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Please do not remind me of it.
I had rotten luck that day. But you
can believe me, Windy would never have
won if it weren't for the ten lengths he
gained at the start. But this time&mdash;never!
You know, of course, it is decided;
we leave town the same day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Same evening, you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> If you will&mdash;but why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Because it's been arranged
we're to be married in the morning,
hasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Quite so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I am so happy. [<i>Embraces
him.</i>] Now, where shall we spend our
honeymoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I take it we're agreed. Aren't
we? On the estate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, of course, later. Aren't
we going to take in the Riviera, as a
preliminary tidbit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> AS for that, it all depends on
the Handicap. If we win&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Surest thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> And besides, in April the
Riviera's not at all good <i>ton</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Is that your reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Of course it is, my love. In
your former way of life, there were so
few opportunities for your getting a
clear idea of fashion&mdash;Pardon me, but
whatever there was, you must admit,
really had its origin in the comic journals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clem, please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Well, well. We'll see. [<i>Continues
reading.</i>] Badegast fifteen to
one&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Badegast? There isn't a ghost
of a show for him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Where did you get that information?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Szigrati himself gave me a tip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Where&mdash;and when?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, this morning in the Fredenau,
while you were talking with Milner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Now, look here; Szigrati isn't
fit company for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Jealous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Not at all. Moreover, let it be
understood that from now on I shall introduce
you everywhere as my fianc&eacute;e. [<i>Margaret kisses him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Now, what did Szigrati say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That he's not going to enter
Badegast in the Handicap at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Well, don't you believe everything
Szigrati is likely to say. He's circulating
the rumor that Badegast will
not be entered so that the odds may be
bigger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Nonsense! That's too much
like an investment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> So you don't believe there is
such a thing as investment in this game?
For a great many it's all a commercial
enterprise. Do you think that a fellow
of Szigrati's ilk cares a fig for sport?
He might just as well speculate on the
market, and wouldn't realize the difference.
Anyway, as far as Badegast is
concerned, one hundred to one wouldn't
be too much to put up against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Really? I found him in first-rate
fettle this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Then you saw Badegast, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Certainly. Didn't Butters put
him through his paces, right behind
Busserl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> But Butters isn't riding for
Szigrati. He was only a stableboy.
Badegast can be in as fine fettle as he
chooses&mdash;it's all the same to me. He's
nothing but a blind. Some day, Margaret,
with the aid of your exceptional
talent, you will be able to distinguish the
veritable somebodies from the shams.
Really, it's remarkable with what proficiency
you have, so to speak, insinuated
yourself into all these things. You go
beyond my expectations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>chagrined</i>]. Pray, why do I
go beyond your expectations? All this,
as you know, is not so new to me. At
our house we entertained very good
people&mdash;Count Libowski and people of
that sort&mdash;and at my husband's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Quite so. No question about
that. As a matter of principle, you
realize, I've no grudge against the cotton
industry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Even if my husband happened
to be the owner of a cotton mill, that
didn't have to effect my personal outlook
on life, did it? I always sought
culture in my own way. Now, don't
let's talk of that period of my life. It's
dead and buried, thank heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Yes. But there's another period
which lies nearer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I know. But why mention it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Well, I simply mean that you
couldn't possibly have heard much about
sportsmanship from your friends in
Munich&mdash;at least, as far as I am able
to judge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I do hope you will stop tormenting
me about those friends in whose
company you first made my acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Tormenting you? Nonsense!
Only it's incomprehensible to me how you
ever got amongst those people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You speak of them as if they were a gang of criminals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Dearest, I'd stake my honor on
it, some of them looked the very picture
of pickpockets. Tell me, how did you
manage to do it? I can't understand
how you, with your refined taste&mdash;let
alone your purity and the scent you used&mdash;could
have tolerated their society.
How could you have sat at the same
table with them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Didn't you do the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Next to them&mdash;not with them.
And for your sake&mdash;merely for your
sake, as you know. To do them justice,
however, I will admit that many bettered
upon closer acquaintance. There were
some interesting people among them.
You mustn't for a moment believe, dearest,
that I hold myself superior to those
who happen to be shabbily dressed.
That's nothing against them. But there
was something in their conduct, in their
manners, which was positively revolting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It wasn't quite so bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Don't take offense, dear. I
said there were some interesting people
among them. But that a lady should
feel at ease in their company, for any
length of time, I cannot and do not pretend
to understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You forget, dear Clem, that in
a sense I'm one of them&mdash;or was at one
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Now, please! For my sake!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> They were artists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Thank goodness, we've returned to the old theme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, because it hurts me to
think you always lose sight of that fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Lose sight of that fact! Nonsense!
You know what pained me in
your writings&mdash;things entirely personal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Let me tell you, Clem, there
are women who, in my situation, would
have done worse than write poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> But what sort of poetry!
What sort of poetry! [<i>Takes a slender
volume from the mantel-shelf.</i>] That's
what repels me. I assure you, every
time I see this book lying here; every
time I think of it, I blush with shame
that it was you who wrote it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That's why you fail to understand&mdash; Now, don't take offense. If
you did understand, you'd be quite perfect,
and that, obviously, is impossible.
Why does it repel you? You know I
didn't live through all the experiences I
write about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> The poems are only visions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> That's just it. That's what
makes me ask: How can a lady indulge
in visions of that character? [<i>Reads.</i>]
"Abandoned on thy breast and suckled
by thy lips" [<i>shaking his head</i>]. How
can a lady write such stuff&mdash;how can
a lady have such stuff printed? That's
what I simply cannot make out. Everybody
who reads will inevitably conjure
up the person of the authoress, and the
particular breast mentioned, and the particular
abandonment hinted at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> But, I'm telling you, no such
breast ever existed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I can't bring myself to imagine
that it did. That's lucky for both of us,
Margaret. But where did these visions
originate? These glowing passion-poems
could not have been inspired by your
first husband. Besides, he could never
appreciate you, as you yourself always
say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Certainly not. That's why I
brought suit for divorce. You know the
story. I just couldn't bear living with
a man who had no other interest in life
than eating and drinking and cotton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I dare say. But that was three
years ago. These poems were written later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Quite so. But consider the position
in which I found myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What do you mean? You
didn't have to endure any privation? In
this respect you must admit your husband
acted very decently toward you.
You were not under the necessity of
earning your own living. And suppose
the publishers did pay you one hundred
gulden for a poem&mdash;surely they don't
pay more than that&mdash;still, you were not
bound to write a book of this sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I did not refer to position in a
material sense. It was the state of my
soul. Have you a notion how&mdash;when
you came to know me&mdash;things were considerably
improved. I had in many ways
found myself again. But in the beginning!
I was so friendless, so crushed!
I tried my hand at everything; I painted,
I gave English lessons in the pension
where I lived. Just think of it! A
divorcee, having nobody&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Why didn't you stay in Vienna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Because I couldn't get along
with my family. No one appreciated me.
Oh, what people! Did any one of them
realize that a woman of my type asks
more of life than a husband, pretty
dresses and social position? My God!
If I had had a child, probably everything
would have ended differently&mdash;and maybe
not. I'm not quite lacking in accomplishments,
you know. Are you still prepared
to complain? Was it not for the
best that I went to Munich? Would I
have made your acquaintance else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> You didn't go there with that
object in view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I wanted to be free spiritually,
I mean. I wanted to prove to myself
whether I could succeed through my own
efforts. And, admit, didn't it look as if
I was jolly well going to? I had made
some headway on the road to fame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> H'm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> But you were dearer to me
than fame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem</span> [<i>good-naturedly</i>]. And surer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I didn't give it a thought. I
suppose it's because I loved you from the
very start. For in my dreams, I always
conjured up a man of your likeness.
I always seemed to realize that it could
only be a man like you who would make
me happy. Blood&mdash;is no empty thing.
Nothing whatever can weigh in the balance
with that. You see, that's why I
can't resist the belief&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, sometimes I think I must
have blue blood in my veins, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> How so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It's not improbable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I'm afraid I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> But I told you that members
of the nobility were entertained at our
house&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Well, and if they were?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Who knows&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Margaret, you're positively
shocking. How can you hint at such a
thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I can never say what I think
in your presence! That's your only
shortcoming&mdash;otherwise you would be
quite perfect. [<i>She smiles up to him.</i>]
You've won my heart completely. That
very first evening, when you walked into
the caf&eacute; with Wangenheim, I had an immediate
presentiment: this is he! You
came among that group, like a soul from
another world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I hope so. And I thank heaven
that somehow you didn't seem to be altogether
one of them, either. No.
Whenever I call to mind that junto&mdash;the
Russian girl, for instance, who because
of her close-cropped hair gave the
appearance of a student&mdash;except that
she did not wear a cap&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Baranzewitsch is a very gifted
painter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> No doubt. You pointed her
out to me one day in the picture gallery.
She was standing on a ladder at the time,
copying. And then the fellow with the
Polish name&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>beginning</i>]. Zrkd&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Spare yourself the pains. You
don't have to use it now any more. He
read something at the caf&eacute; while I was
there, without putting himself out the
least bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> He's a man of extraordinary
talent. I'll vouch for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Oh, no doubt. Everybody is
talented at the caf&eacute;. And then that
yokel, that insufferable&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> You know whom I mean. That
fellow who persisted in making tactless
observations about the aristocracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Gilbert. You must mean Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Yes. Of course. I don't feel
called upon to make a brief for my class.
Profligates crop up everywhere, even
among writers, I understand. But, don't
you know it was very bad taste on his
part while one of us was present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That's just like him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I had to hold myself in check
not to knock him down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> In spite of that, he was quite
interesting. And, then, you mustn't forget
he was raving jealous of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I thought I noticed that, too. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Good heavens, they were all
jealous of you. Naturally enough&mdash;you
were so unlike them. They all paid
court to me because I wouldn't discriminate
in favor of any one of them. You
certainly must have noticed that, eh?
Why are you laughing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Comical&mdash;is no word for it!
If some one had prophesied to me that
I was going to marry a regular frequenter
of the Caf&eacute; Maxmillian&mdash;I
fancied the two young painters most.
They'd have made an incomparable
vaudeville team. Do you know, they resembled
each other so much and owned
everything they possessed in common&mdash;and,
if I'm not mistaken, the Russian on
the ladder along with the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I didn't bother myself with
such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> And, then, both must have been
Jews?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Why so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Oh, simply because they always
jested in such a way. And their
enunciation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You may spare your anti-Semitic
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Now, sweetheart, don't be
touchy. I know that your blood is not
untainted, and I have nothing whatever
against the Jews. I once had a tutor in
Greek who was a Jew. Upon my word!
He was a capital fellow. One meets all
sorts and conditions of people. I don't
in the least regret having made the acquaintance
of your associates in Munich.
It's all the weave of our life experience.
But I can't help thinking that I must
have appeared to you like a hero come to
rescue you in the nick of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, so you did. My Clem!
Clem! [<i>Embraces him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What are you laughing at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Something's just occurred to
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> "Abandoned on thy breast
and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> [<i>vexed</i>]. Please! Must you always
shatter my illusions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Tell me truly, Clem, wouldn't
you be proud if your fianc&eacute;e, your wife,
were to become a great, a famous writer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I have already told you. I am
rooted in my decision. And I promise
you that if you begin scribbling or publishing
poems in which you paint your
passion for me, and sing to the world
the progress of our love&mdash;it's all up
with our wedding, and off I go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You threaten&mdash;you, who have
had a dozen well-known affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> My dear, well-known or not,
I didn't tell anybody. I didn't bring out
a book whenever a woman abandoned
herself on my breast, so that any Tom,
Dick or Harry could buy it for a gulden
and a half. There's the rub. I know
there are people who thrive by it, but, as
for me, I find it extremely coarse. It's
more degrading to me than if you were
to pose as a Greek goddess in flesh-colored
tights at Ronacher's. A Greek
statue like that doesn't say "Mew." But
a writer who makes copy of everything
goes beyond the merely humorous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Dearest, you forget
that the poet does not always tell the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> And suppose he only vaporizes.
Does that make it any better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It isn't called vaporizing; it's
"<i>distillation</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What sort of an expression is
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> We disclose things we never
experience, things we dreamed&mdash;plainly
invented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Don't say "we" any more,
Margaret. Thank goodness, that is past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Who knows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Clement, I must
tell you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It is not past; I haven't given
up my writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I'm still going on with my
writing, or, rather, I've finished writing
another book. Yes, the impulse is
stronger than most people realize. I
really believe I should have gone to
pieces if it hadn't been for my writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What have you written now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> A novel. The weight was too
heavy to be borne. It might have
dragged me down&mdash;down. Until to-day,
I tried to hide it from you, but it had
to come out at last. K&uuml;nigel is immensely
taken with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Who's K&uuml;nigel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> My publisher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Then it's been read already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, and lots more will read it.
Clement, you will have cause to be proud,
believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> You're mistaken, my dear. I
think&mdash;but, tell me, what's it about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I can't tell you right off. The
novel contains the greatest part, so to
speak, and all that can be said of the
greatest part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> My compliments!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That's why I'm going to promise
you never to pick up a pen any more.
I don't need to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Margaret, do you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What a question! You and
you only. Though I have seen a great
deal, though I have gadded about a great
deal, I have experienced comparatively
little. I have waited all my life for your
coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Well, let me have the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Why&mdash;why? What do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I grant you, there was some
excuse in your having written it; but it
doesn't follow that it's got to be read.
Let me have it, and we'll throw it into
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clem!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I make that request. I have
a right to make it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Impossible! It simply&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Why? If I wish it; if I tell
you our whole future depends on it. Do
you understand? Is it still impossible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> But, Clement, the novel has already
been printed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> What! Printed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes. In a few days it will be on sale on all the book-stalls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Margaret, you did all that without a word to me&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I couldn't do otherwise. When once you see it, you will forgive me.
More than that, you will be proud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> My dear, this has progressed beyond a joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clement!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Adieu, Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clement, what does this mean?
You are leaving?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> As you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> When are you coming back again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I can't say just now. Adieu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clement! [<i>Tries to hold him back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Please. [<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>alone</i>]. Clement! What does this mean? He's left me for good.
What shall I do? Clement! Is everything between us at an end? No. It can't be. Clement!
I'll go after him. [<i>She looks for her hat. The doorbell rings.</i>]
Ah, he's coming back. He only wanted to frighten me. Oh, my Clement!
[<i>Goes to the door. Gilbert enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>to the maid</i>]. I told you so.
Madame's at home. How do you do, Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>astonished</i>]. You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> It's I&mdash;I. Amandus Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I'm so surprised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> So I see. There's no cause for it. I merely thought I'd stop over.
I'm on my way to Italy. I came to offer you my latest book for auld lang
syne. [<i>Hands her the book. As she does not take it, he places it on the
table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It's very good of you. Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> You have a certain proprietorship in that book. So you are living
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Opposite the stadium, I see. As far as furnished rooms go, it's passable
enough. But these family portraits on the walls would drive me crazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> My housekeeper's the widow of a general.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Oh, you needn't apologize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Apologize! Really, the idea never occurred to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> It's wonderful to hark back to it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> To what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Why shouldn't I say it? To the small room in Steinsdorf street,
with its balcony abutting over the Isar. Do you remember, Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Suppose we drop the familiar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> As you please&mdash;as you please. [<i>Pause, then suddenly.</i>] You acted shamefully, Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Would you much rather that I beat around the bush? I can find no
other word, to my regret. And it was so uncalled for, too. Straightforwardness
would have done just as nicely. It was quite unnecessary to run away
from Munich under cover of a foggy night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It wasn't night and it wasn't foggy. I left in the morning on the
eight-thirty train, in open daylight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> At all events, you might have said good-by to me before leaving, eh?
[<i>Sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I expect the Baron back any minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What difference does that make? Of course, you didn't tell him that you
lay in my arms once and worshiped me. I'm just an old acquaintance from Munich.
And there's no harm in an old acquaintance calling to see you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Anybody but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Why? Why do you persist in misunderstanding me? I assure you, I
come <i>only</i> as an old acquaintance. Everything else is dead and buried, long
dead and buried. Here. See for yourself. [<i>Indicates the book.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> My latest novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Have you taken to writing novels?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Since when have you learned the trick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Heavens, can't I remember? Thumb-nail sketches were your specialty,
observation of daily events.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. My specialty? My specialty is life itself. I write what suits
me. I do not allow myself to be circumscribed.
I don't see who's to prevent my
writing a novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> But the opinion of an authority
was&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Pray, who's an authority?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I call to mind, for instance, an
article by Neumann in the "Algemeine"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Neumann's a blamed
idiot! I boxed his ears for him once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> In effigy&mdash; But you were quite
as much wrought up about the business
as I at that time. We were perfectly
agreed that Neumann was a blamed idiot.
"How can such a numbskull dare"&mdash;these
were your very words&mdash;"to set
bounds to your genius? How can he
dare to stifle your next work still, so to
speak, in the womb?" You said that!
And to-day you quote that literary
hawker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Please do not shout. My
housekeeper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I don't propose to bother myself
about the widows of defunct generals
when every nerve in my body is a-tingle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What did I say? I can't account
for your touchiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Touchiness! You call me touchy?
You! Who used to be seized with a violent
fit of trembling every time some insignificant
booby or some trumpery sheet
happened to utter an unfavorable word
of criticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I don't remember one word of
unfavorable criticism against me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> H'm! I dare say you may be
right. Critics are always chivalrous toward
beautiful women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Chivalrous? Do you think my
poems were praised out of chivalry?
What about your own estimate&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Mine? I'm not going to retract
so much as one little word. I simply
want to remind you that you composed
your sheaf of lovely poems while we were
living together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> And you actually consider
yourself worthy of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Would you have written them if
it weren't for me? They are addressed
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What! Do you mean to deny
that they are addressed to me? This is
monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> No. They are not addressed
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I am dumbfounded. I shall remind
you of the situations in which some
of your loveliest verses had birth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> They were inscribed to an
Ideal&mdash;[<i>Gilbert points to himself</i>]&mdash;whose
representative on earth you happened
to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Ha! This is precious. Where
did you get that? Do you know what
the French would say in a case like that?
"C'est de la litt&eacute;rature!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>mimicking him</i>]. Ce n'est pas
de la litt&eacute;rature! Now, that's the truth,
the honest truth! Or do you really
fancy that by the "slim boy" I meant
you? Or that the curls I hymned belonged
to you? At that time you were
fat and your hair was never curly.
[<i>Runs her fingers through his hair.
Gilbert seizes the opportunity to capture
her hand and kiss it.</i>] What an idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> At that time you pictured it so;
or, at all events, that is what you called
it. To be sure, a poet is forced to take
every sort of license for the sake of the
rhythm. Didn't I once apostrophise you
in a sonnet as "my canny lass"? In
point of fact, you were neither&mdash;no, I
don't want to be unfair&mdash;you were canny,
shamefully canny, perversely canny.
And it suited you perfectly. Well, I
suppose I really oughtn't to wonder at
you. You were at all times a snob.
And, by Jove! you've attained your end.
You have decoyed your blue-blooded boy
with his well-manicured hands and his
unmanicured brain, your matchless horseman,
fencer, marksman, tennis player,
heart-trifler&mdash;Marlitt could not have invented
him more revolting than he actually
is. Yes, what more can you wish?
Whether he will satisfy you&mdash;who are
acquainted with something nobler&mdash;is, of
course, another question. I can only say
that, in my view, you are degenerate in
love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That must have struck you on
the train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Not at all. It struck me this
very moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Make a note of it then; it's an
apt phrase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I've another quite as apt. Formerly
you were a woman; now you're a
"sweet thing." Yes, that's it. What attracted
you to a man of that type? Passion&mdash;frank
and filthy passion&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Stop! You have a motive&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> My dear, I still lay claim to the
possession of a soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Except now and then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Please don't try to disparage our
former relations. It's no use. They are
the noblest experiences you've ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Heavens, when I think that I
endured this twaddle for one whole year
I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Endure? You were intoxicated
with joy. Don't try to be ungrateful.
I'm not. Admitting that you behaved
never so execrably at the end, yet I can't
bring myself to look upon it with bitterness.
It had to come just that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I owe you an explanation. This:
at the moment when you were beginning
to drift away from me, when homesickness
for the stables gripped you&mdash;<i>la
nostalgie de l'&eacute;curie</i>&mdash;at that moment I
was done with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> You failed to notice the least
sign in your characteristic way. I was
done with you. To be plain, I didn't
need you any longer. What you had to
give you gave me. Your uses were fulfilled.
In the depths of your soul you
knew, unconsciously you knew&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Please don't get so hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>unruffled</i>]. That our day was
over. Our relations had served their
purpose. I don't regret having loved
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Capital! This measly outburst
must reveal to a person of any insight
just one thing: the essential line of difference
between the artist and the dilettante.
To you, Margaret, our <i>liaison</i>
means nothing more than the memory of
a few abandoned nights, a few heart-to-heart
talks in the winding ways of the
English gardens. But <i>I</i> have made it
over into a work of art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> So have I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Eh? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I have done what you have
done. I, too, have written a novel in
which our relations are depicted. I, too,
have embalmed our love&mdash;or what we
thought was our love&mdash;for all time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> If I were you, I wouldn't talk
of "for all time" before the appearance
of the second edition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Your writing a novel and my
writing a novel are two different things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You are a free man. You
don't have to steal your hours devoted
to artistic labor. And your future
doesn't depend on the throw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> And you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> That's what I've done. Only
a half hour ago Clement left me because
I confessed to him that I had written a
novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Left you&mdash;for good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I don't know. But it isn't unlikely.
He went away in a fit of anger.
What he'll decide to do I can't
say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> So he objects to your writing,
does he? He can't bear to see his mistress
put her intelligence to some use.
Capital! And he represents the blood
of the country! H'm! And you, you're
not ashamed to give yourself up to the
arms of an idiot of this sort, whom you
once&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Don't you speak of him like
that. You don't know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You don't know why he objects
to my writing. Purely out of love.
He feels that if I go on I will be living
in a world entirely apart from him. He
blushes at the thought that I should make
copy of the most sacred feelings of my
soul for unknown people to read. It is
his wish that I belong to him only, and
that is why he dashed out&mdash;no, not
dashed out&mdash;for Clement doesn't belong
to the class that dashes out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Your observation is well taken.
In any case, he went away. We will not
undertake to discuss the <i>tempo</i> of his
going forth. And he went away because
he could not bear to see you surrender
yourself to the creative impulse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Ah, if he could only understand
that! But, of course, that can never
be! I could be the best, the faithfulest,
the noblest woman in the world if the
right man only existed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> At all events, you admit he is
not the right man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I never said that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> But you ought to realize that
he's fettering you, undoing you utterly,
seeking through egotism, to destroy your
inalienable self. Look back for a moment
at the Margaret you were; at the
freedom that was yours while you loved
me. Think of the younger set who gathered
about me and who belonged no
whit less to you? Do you never long
for those days? Do you never call to
mind the small room with its balcony&mdash;Beneath
us plunged the Isar&mdash;[<i>He
seizes her hand and presses her near.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> All's not beyond recall. It need
not be the Isar, need it? I have something
to propose to you, Margaret. Tell
him, when he returns, that you still have
some important matters to arrange at
Munich, and spend the time with me.
Margaret, you are so lovely! We shall
be happy again as then. Do you remember
[<i>very near her</i>] "Abandoned on thy
breast and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>retreating brusquely from
him</i>]. Go, go away. No, no. Please go
away. I don't love you any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Oh, h'm&mdash;indeed! Oh, in that
case I beg your pardon. [<i>Pause.</i>]
Adieu, Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Adieu.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Won't you present me with a
copy of your novel as a parting gift, as
I have done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It hasn't come out yet. It
won't be on sale before next week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Pardon my inquisitiveness, what
kind of a story is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> The story of my life. So
veiled, to be sure, that I am in no danger
of being recognized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I see. How did you manage to
do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Very simple. For one thing,
the heroine is not a writer but a painter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Very clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Her first husband is not a cotton
manufacturer, but a big financier,
and, of course, it wouldn't do to deceive
him with a tenor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Ha! Ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What strikes you so funny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> So you deceived him with a
tenor? I didn't know that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Whoever said so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Why, you yourself, just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> How so? I say the heroine of
the book deceives her husband with a
baritone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Bass would have been more sublime,
mezzo-soprano more piquant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Then she doesn't go to Munich,
but to Dresden; and there, has an affair
with a sculptor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> That's me&mdash;veiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Very much veiled, I rather
fear. The sculptor, as it happens, is
young, handsome and a genius. In spite
of that she leaves him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> For&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Guess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> A jockey, I fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Wretch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> A count, a prince of the empire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Wrong. An archduke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I must say you have spared no
costs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, an archduke, who gave up
the court for her sake, married her and
emigrated with her to the Canary Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> The Canary Islands! Splendid!
And then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> With the disembarkation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> In Canaryland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> The story ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Good. I'm very much interested,
especially in the veiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> You yourself wouldn't recognize
me were it not for&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> The third chapter from the
end, where our correspondence is published
entire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes, all the letters you sent me
and those I sent you are included in the
novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I see, but may I ask where you
got those you sent me? I thought I had
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I know. But, you see, I had
the habit of always making a rough
draft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> A rough draft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> A rough draft? Those letters
which seemed to have been dashed off in
such tremendous haste. "Just one word,
dearest, before I go to bed. My eyelids
are heavy&mdash;" and when your eyelids
were closed you wrote the whole
thing over again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Are you piqued about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I might have expected as much.
I ought to be glad, however, that they
weren't bought from a professional love-letter
writer. Oh, how everything begins
to crumble! The whole past is
nothing but a heap of ruins. She made
a rough draft of her letters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Be content. Maybe my letters
will be all that will remain immortal of
your memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> And along with them will remain
the fatal story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>indicating his book</i>]. Because
they also appear in my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> In <i>where</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> In my novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Our letters&mdash;yours and mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Where did you get your own?
I've got them in my possession. Ah, so
you, too, made a rough draft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Nothing of the kind! I only
copied them before mailing. I didn't
want to lose them. There are some in
my book which you didn't even get.
They were, in my opinion, too beautiful
for you. You wouldn't have understood
them at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Merciful heavens! If this is
so&mdash;[<i>turning the leaves of Gilbert's
book</i>]. Yes, yes, it is so. Why, it's just
like telling the world that we two&mdash;Merciful
heavens! [<i>Feverishly turning
the leaves.</i>] Is the letter you sent me
the morning after the first night also&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Surely. That was brilliant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> This is horrible. Why, this is
going to create a European sensation.
And Clement&mdash;My God; I'm beginning
to hope that he will not come back. I
am ruined! And you along with me.
Wherever you are, he'll be sure to find
you and blow your brains out like a mad
dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>pocketing his book</i>]. Insipid
comparison!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> How did you hit upon such an
insane idea? To publish the correspondence
of a woman whom, in all sincerity,
you professed to have loved! Oh, you're
no gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Quite charming. Haven't you
done the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I'm a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Do you take refuge in that now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, it's true. I have nothing
to reproach you with. We were made
for one another. Yes, Clement was right.
We're worse than those women who appear
in flesh-colored tights. Our most
sacred feelings, our pangs&mdash;everything&mdash;we
make copy of everything. Pfui!
<b>Pfui!</b> It's sickening. We two belong to
one another. Clement would only be
doing what is right if he drove me away.
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] Come, Amandus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I accept your proposal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What proposal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I'm going to cut it with you.
[<i>Looks for her hat and cloak.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Eh? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>very much excited; puts her
hat on tightly</i>]. Everything can be as it
was. You've said it. It needn't be the
Isar&mdash;well, I'm ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Sheer madness! Cut it&mdash;what's
the meaning of this? Didn't you yourself
say a minute ago that he'd find me anywhere.
If you're with me, he'll have no
difficulty in finding you, too. Wouldn't
it be better if each&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Wretch! Now you want to
leave me in a lurch! Why, only a few
minutes ago you were on your knees before
me. Have you no conscience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What's the use? I am a sick,
nervous man, suffering from hypochondria.
[<i>Margaret at the window utters a
cry.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What's up? What will the general's
widow think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It's he. He's coming back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Well, then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> What? You intend to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I didn't come here to pay the
baron a visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> He'll encounter you on the
stairs. That would be worse. Stay. I
refuse to be sacrificed alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Now, don't lose your senses.
Why do you tremble like that? It's
quite absurd to believe that he's already
gone through both novels. Calm yourself.
Remove your hat. Off with your
cloak. [<i>Assists her.</i>] If he catches you
in this frame of mind he can't help but
suspect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It's all the same to me. Better
now than later. I can't bear waiting
and waiting for the horrible event. I'm
going to tell him everything right away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Yes. And while you are still
here. If I make a clean breast of everything
now maybe he'll forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> And me&mdash;what about me? I
have a higher mission in the world, I
think, than to suffer myself to be shot
down like a mad dog by a jealous baron.
[<i>The bell rings.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> It's he! It's he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Understand, you're not to breathe
a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> I've made up my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Indeed, have a care. For, if you
do, I shall sell my hide at a good price.
I shall hurl such naked truths at him
that he'll swear no baron heard the like
of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> [<i>entering, somewhat surprised,
but quite cool and courteous</i>]. Oh, Mr.
Gilbert! Am I right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> The very same, Baron. I'm traveling
south, and I couldn't repress the
desire to pay my respects to madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Ah, indeed. [<i>Pause.</i>] Pardon
me, it seems I've interrupted your conversation.
Pray, don't let me disturb
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What were we talking about just
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Perhaps I can assist your memory.
In Munich, if I recall correctly,
you always talked about your books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Quite so. As a matter of fact,
I was speaking about my new novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Pray, continue. Nowadays, I
find that I, too, can talk literature. Eh,
Margaret? Is it naturalistic? Symbolic?
Autobiographical? Or&mdash;let me
see&mdash;is it distilled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Oh, in a certain sense we all
write about our life-experiences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> H'm. That's good to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Yes, if you're painting the character
of Nero, in my opinion it's absolutely
necessary that you should have set
fire to Rome&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> From what source should a
writer derive his inspiration if not from
himself? Where should he go for his
models if not to the life which is nearest
to him? [<i>Margaret becomes more and
more uneasy.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Isn't it a pity, though, that the
models are so rarely consulted? But I
must say, if I were a woman, I'd think
twice before I'd let such people know
anything&mdash;[<i>Sharply.</i>] In decent society,
sir, that's the same as compromising
a woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I don't know whether I belong to
decent society or not, but, in my humble
opinion, it's the same as ennobling a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> The essential thing is, does it
really hit the mark! In a higher sense,
what does it matter if the public does
know that a woman was happy in this
bed or that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Mr. Gilbert, allow me to remind
you that you are speaking in the
presence of a lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> I'm speaking in the presence of
a comrade, Baron, who, perhaps, shares
my views in these matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Clement! [<i>Throws herself at
his feet.</i>] Clement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> [<i>staggered</i>]. But&mdash;Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Your forgiveness, Clement!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> But, Margaret. [<i>To Gilbert.</i>]
It's very painful to me, Mr. Gilbert.
Now, get up, Margaret. Get up, everything's
all right; everything's arranged.
Yes, yes. You have but to call up K&uuml;nigel.
I have already arranged everything
with him. We are going to put it out
for sale. Is that suitable to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> What are you going to put out
for sale, if I may be so bold as to ask?
The novel madame has written?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Ah, so you know already. At
all events, Mr. Gilbert, it seems that your
<i>camaraderie</i> is not required any further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Yes. There's really nothing left
for me but to beg to be excused. I'm
sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> I very much regret, Mr. Gilbert,
that you had to witness a scene
which might almost be called domestic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Oh, I do not wish to intrude any
further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> Madame&mdash;Baron, may I offer
you a copy of my book as a token that
all ill-feeling between us has vanished?
As a feeble sign of my sympathy, Baron?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> You're very good, Mr. Gilbert.
I must, however, tell you that this is
going to be the last, or the one before
the last, that I ever intend to read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> The one before the last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> And what's the last going to
be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> Yours, my love. [<i>Draws an
advanced copy from his pocket.</i>] I
wheedled an advance copy from K&uuml;nigel
to bring to you, or, rather, to both of us.
[<i>Margaret and Gilbert exchange scared
glances.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> How good of you! [<i>Taking
the book.</i>] Yes, it's mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> We will read it together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> No, Clement, no. I cannot accept
so much kindness. [<i>She throws the
book into the fireplace.</i>] I don't want to
hear of this sort of thing any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>very joyful</i>]. But, dear madame&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clem.</span> [<i>going toward the fireplace</i>].
Margaret, what have you done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> [<i>in front of the fireplace, throwing
her arms about Clement</i>]. Now, do
you believe that I love you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gil.</span> [<i>most gleeful</i>]. It appears that
I'm entirely <i>de trop</i> here. Dear Madame&mdash;Baron&mdash;[<i>To
himself.</i>] Pity, though,
I can't stay for the last chapter. [<i>Goes
out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You know quite well that
your father-in-law likes to alarm us needlessly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I don't see things
as you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You ought to rely on us,
then, who can see. She looked very well
this afternoon. She is sleeping quietly
now; and we are not going to mar, needlessly,
the first pleasant evening that
chance has put in our way.... It seems
to me we have a perfect right to peace,
and even to laugh a little, this evening,
without fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> That's true; this is the
first time I have felt at home with my
family since this terrible confinement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> When once illness has
come into a house, it is as though a
stranger had forced himself into the family
circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> And then you understand,
too, that you can count on no one
outside the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You are quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Why couldn't I
see my poor daughter to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You know quite well&mdash;the
doctor forbade it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not know
what to think....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> It is useless to worry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>pointing to the
door on the left</i>]. She cannot hear us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> We will not talk too
loud; besides, the door is very thick, and
the Sister of Mercy is with her, and she
is sure to warn us if we are making too
much noise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>pointing to the
door on the right</i>]. He cannot hear us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> No, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> He is asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Some one had
better go and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> The little one would
cause <i>me</i> more anxiety than your wife.
It is now several weeks since he was
born, and he has scarcely stirred. He
has not cried once all the time! He is
like a wax doll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I think he will be
deaf&mdash;dumb too, perhaps&mdash;the usual
result of a marriage between cousins....
[<i>A reproving silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> I could almost wish
him ill for the suffering he has caused his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Do be reasonable; it is
not the poor little thing's fault. He is
quite alone in the room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Yes; the doctor does
not wish him to stay in his mother's room
any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> But the nurse is with
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> No; she has gone to
rest a little; she has well deserved it
these last few days. Ursula, just go and
see if he is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> Yes, father.
[<i>The Three Sisters get up, and go into
the room on the right, hand in hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> When will your sister
come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I think she will come
about nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> It is past nine. I hope
she will come this evening, my wife is
so anxious to see her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> She is sure to come.
This will be the first time she has been
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> She has never been in
the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> It is very difficult for
her to leave her convent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Will she be alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I expect one of the nuns
will come with her. They are not allowed
to go out alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> But she is the Superior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> The rule is the same for
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Do you not feel
anxious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Why should we feel
anxious? What's the good of harping
on that? There is nothing more to
fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Your sister is
older than you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> She is the eldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not know
what ails me; I feel uneasy. I wish your
sister were here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> She will come; she promised
to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Ah, if this evening
were only over!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The three daughters come in again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Waiting for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Waiting for our sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You see nothing coming,
Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter</span> [<i>at the window</i>].
Nothing, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Not in the avenue?
Can you see the avenue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes, father; it is
moonlight, and I can see the avenue as
far as the cypress wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> And you do not
see any one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> No one, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> What sort of a night is
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Very fine. Do you
hear the nightingales?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> A little wind is rising
in the avenue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> A little wind in
the avenue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes; the trees are
trembling a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I am surprised that my
sister is not here yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I cannot hear the
nightingales any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I think some one has
come into the garden, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I do not know; I can
see no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Because there is no one
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> There must be some
one in the garden; the nightingales have
suddenly ceased singing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> But I do not hear
any one coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Some one must be
passing by the pond, because the swans
are ruffled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Daughter.</span> All the fishes in
the pond are diving suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You cannot see any
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> No one, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> But the pond lies in
the moonlight....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes; I can see that
the swans are ruffled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I am sure it is my sister
who is scaring them. She must have
come in by the little gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> I cannot understand
why the dogs do not bark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I can see the watchdog
right at the back of his kennel. The
swans are crossing to the other bank!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> They are afraid of my
sister. I will go and see. [<i>He calls.</i>]
Sister! sister! Is that you?... There
is no one there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I am sure that some
one has come into the garden. You will
see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> But she would answer
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Are not the nightingales
beginning to sing again, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I cannot hear one
anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> But there is no
noise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> There is a silence of the
grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It must be a
stranger that is frightening them, for if
it were one of the family they would not
be silent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> How much longer are
you going to discuss these nightingales?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Are all the windows
open, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> The glass door is
open, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It seems to me
that the cold is penetrating into the
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> There is a little wind
in the garden, grandfather, and the rose-leaves
are falling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Well, shut the door. It
is late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes, father.... I
cannot shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Two Other Daughters.</span> We cannot
shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Why, what is the
matter with the door, my children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You need not say that
in such an extraordinary voice. I will
go and help them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> We cannot
manage to shut it quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> It is because of the
damp. Let us all push together. There
must be something in the way.</p>

it right to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Is the carpenter

Oh!</p>

I think it is the gardener. I cannot quite
see; he is in the shadow of the house.</p>

the house.</p>

He has not slept for three nights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> He has been so much
worried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> He always worries too
much. At times he will not listen to
reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> It is quite excusable at
his age.</p>

no distractions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> That must be terrible.</p>

used to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I cannot imagine it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> They are certainly to
be pitied.</p>

is, not to know where one has come
from, not to know whither one is going,
not to be able to distinguish midday from
midnight, or summer from winter&mdash;and
always darkness, darkness! I would
rather not live. Is it absolutely incurable?</p>

blind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> And your sister
is not here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Our sister has not come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You want to deceive
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Deceive you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Ursula, tell me
the truth, for the love of God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> Grandfather!
Grandfather! what is the matter with
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Something has
happened! I am sure my daughter is
worse!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Are you dreaming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You do not want
to tell me!... I can see quite well there
is something....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> In that case you can see
better than we can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Ursula, tell me
the truth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> But we have told
you the truth, grandfather!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You do not speak
in your ordinary voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> That is because you
frighten her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Your voice is
changed, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You are going mad!
[<i>He and the Uncle make signs to each
other to signify the Grandfather has
lost his reason.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I can hear quite
well that you are afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> But what should we be
afraid of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Why do you want
to deceive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Who is thinking of deceiving
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Why have you
put out the light?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> But the light has not
been put out; there is as much light as
there was before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> It seems to me that
the lamp has gone down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> I see as well now as
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I have millstones
on my eyes! Tell me, girls, what is
going on here! Tell me, for the love of
God, you who can see! I am here, all
alone, in darkness without end! I do
not know who seats himself beside me!
I do not know what is happening a yard
from me!... Why were you talking
under your breath just now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> No one was talking
under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You did talk in a
low voice at the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You heard all I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You brought
some one into the room!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> But I tell you no one
has come in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Is it your sister
or a priest?&mdash;You should not try to deceive
me.&mdash;Ursula, who was it that came
in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> No one, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You must not
try to deceive me; I know what I
know.&mdash;How many of us are there
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> There are six of us
round the table, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are all round
the table?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are there,
Paul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are there,
Oliver?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Yes, of course I am here,
in my usual place. That's not alarming,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are there,
Genevi&egrave;ve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One of the Daughters.</span> Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are there,
Gertrude?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Daughter.</span> Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are here,
Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> Yes, grandfather;
next to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> And who is that
sitting there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Where do you mean,
grandfather?&mdash;There is no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> There, there&mdash;in
the midst of us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> But there is no one,
grandfather!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> We tell you there is no
one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> But you cannot
see&mdash;any of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Pshaw! You are joking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not feel inclined
for joking, I can assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Then believe those who
can see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>undecidedly</i>]. I
thought there was some one.... I believe
I shall not live long....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Why should we deceive
you? What use would there be in
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> It would be our duty to
tell you the truth....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> What would be the good
of deceiving each other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You could not live in
error long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>trying to rise</i>]. I
should like to pierce this darkness!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Where do you want to
go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Over there....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Don't be so anxious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You are strange this
evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It is all of you
who seem to me to be strange!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Do you want anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not know
what ails me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> Grandfather!
grandfather! What do you want, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Give me your little
hands, my children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three Daughters.</span> Yes, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Why are you all
three trembling, girls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> We are
scarcely trembling at all, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I fancy you are
all three pale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> It is late,
grandfather, and we are tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> You must go to bed,
and grandfather himself would do well
to take a little rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I could not sleep
to-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> We will wait for the
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Prepare for the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> But there is no truth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Then I do not
know what there is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I tell you there is nothing
at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I wish I could see
my poor daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> But you know quite
well it is impossible; she must not be
awakened unnecessarily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You will see her to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> There is no sound
in her room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I should be uneasy if I
heard any sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It is a very long
time since I saw my daughter!... I
took her hands yesterday evening, but I
could not see her!... I do not know
what has become of her.... I do not
know how she is.... I do not know what
her face is like now.... She must have
changed these weeks!... I felt the little
bones of her cheeks under my hands....
There is nothing but the darkness
between her and me, and the rest of you!...
I cannot go on living like this ...
this is not living.... You sit there, all of
you, looking with open eyes at my dead
eyes, and not one of you has pity on me!...
I do not know what ails me....
No one tells me what ought to be told
me.... And everything is terrifying
when one's dreams dwell upon it....
But why are you not speaking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> What should <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'be'">we</ins> say,
since you will not believe us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You are afraid of
betraying yourselves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Come now, be rational!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> You have been
hiding something from me for a long
time!... Something has happened in
the house.... But I am beginning to
understand now.... You have been deceiving
me too long!&mdash;You fancy that I
shall never know anything?&mdash;There are
moments when I am less blind than you,
you know!... Do you think I have not
heard you whispering&mdash;for days and
days&mdash;as if you were in the house of
some one who had been hanged&mdash;I dare
not say what I know this evening....
But I shall know the truth!... I shall
wait for you to tell me the truth; but I
have known it for a long time, in spite of
you!&mdash;And now, I feel that you are all
paler than the dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three Daughters.</span> Grandfather!
grandfather! What is the matter,
grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It is not you that
I am speaking of, girls. No; it is not
you that I am speaking of.... I know
quite well you would tell me the truth&mdash;if
they were not by!... And besides,
I feel sure that they are deceiving you
as well.... You will see, children&mdash;you
will see!... Do not I hear you all sobbing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Is my wife really so
ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It is no good trying
to deceive me any longer; it is too
late now, and I know the truth better
than you!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> But <i>we</i> are not blind; we
are not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Would you like to go
into your daughter's room? This misunderstanding
must be put an end to.&mdash;Would
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>becoming suddenly
undecided</i>]. No, no, not now&mdash;not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> You see, you are not
reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> One never knows
how much a man has been unable to express
in his life!... Who made that
noise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> It is the lamp
flickering, grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It seems to me to
be very unsteady&mdash;very!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> It is the cold wind
troubling it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> There is no cold wind,
the windows are shut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I think it is going
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> There is no more oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> It has gone right
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> We cannot stay like
this in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Why not?&mdash;I am quite
accustomed to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> There is a light in my
wife's room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> We will take it from
there presently, when the doctor has
been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Well, we can see
enough here; there is the light from outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Is it light outside?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Lighter than here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> For my part, I would as
soon talk in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> So would I. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> It seems to me the
clock makes a great deal of noise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Eldest Daughter.</span> That is because
we are not talking any more,
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> But why are you
all silent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> What do you want us to
talk about?&mdash;You are really very peculiar
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Is it very dark in
this room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> There is not much light.
[<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not feel well,
Ursula; open the window a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Yes, child; open the
window a little. I begin to feel the want
of air myself. [<i>The girl opens the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> I really believe we have
stayed shut up too long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Is the window
open?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes, grandfather; it
is wide open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> One would not
have thought it was open; there was not
a sound outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> No, grandfather;
there is not the slightest sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> The silence is extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> One could hear an
angel tread!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> That is why I do not like
the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I wish I could
hear some sound. What o'clock is it,
Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> It will soon be midnight,
grandfather. [<i>Here the Uncle begins
to pace up and down the room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Who is that walking
round us like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Only I! only I! Do not
be frightened! I want to walk about a
little. [<i>Silence.</i>]&mdash;But I am going to
sit down again;&mdash;I cannot see where I
am going. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I wish I were out
of this place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Where would you like
to go, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I do not know
where&mdash;into another room, no matter
where! no matter where!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Where could we go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> It is too late to go anywhere
else. [<i>Silence. They are sitting,
motionless, round the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> What is that I
hear, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Nothing, grandfather;
it is the leaves falling.&mdash;Yes, it
is the leaves falling on the terrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Go and shut the
window, Ursula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Yes, grandfather.
[<i>She shuts the window, comes back, and
sits down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I am cold. [<i>Silence.
The Three Sisters kiss each
other.</i>] What is that I hear now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> It is the three sisters
kissing each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> It seems to me they are
very pale this evening. [<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> What is that I
hear now, Ursula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> Nothing, grandfather;
it is the clasping of my hands.
[<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> And that?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Daughter.</span> I do not know,
grandfather ... perhaps my sisters are
trembling a little?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> I am afraid, too,
my children. [<i>Here a ray of moonlight
penetrates through a corner of the
stained glass, and throws strange gleams
here and there in the room. A clock
strikes midnight; at the last stroke there
is a very vague sound, as of some one
rising in haste.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span> [<i>shuddering with
peculiar horror</i>]. Who is that who got
up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> No one got up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> I did not get up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three Daughters.</span> Nor I!&mdash;Nor
I!&mdash;Nor I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Some one got up
from the table!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> Light the lamp!...
[<i>Cries of terror are suddenly heard from
the child's room, on the right; these cries
continue, with gradations of horror, until
the end of the scene.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Listen to the child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> He has never cried before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father.</span> Let us go and see him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle.</span> The light! The light!
[<i>At this moment, quick and heavy steps
are heard in the room on the left.&mdash;Then
a deathly silence.&mdash;They listen in mute
terror, until the door of the room opens
slowly; the light from it is cast into the
room where they are sitting, and the Sister
of Mercy appears on the threshold,
in her black garments, and bows as she
makes the sign of the cross, to announce
the death of the wife. They understand,
and, after a moment of hesitation and
fright, silently enter the chamber of
death, while the Uncle politely steps aside
on the threshold to let the three girls
pass. The blind man, left alone, gets
up, agitated, and feels his way round the
table in the darkness.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather.</span> Where are you
going?&mdash;Where are you going?&mdash;The
girls have left me all alone!</p>

<p class="noidt">Pardon, marquise, but it is folly<br />

Poetry is woven of agile thought.<br />

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">All that</span><br />
Is reached with the noble aid of a consonant<br />
As great love is reached with a kiss.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">And what of the void in which my soul is lost<br />
Since no one, poet ... no one cries his need for me....<br />

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Do not say that, marquise. I can assure you....</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">That I am a motif for a handful of consonants?</p>

<p class="noidt">Nonsense! I swear it by your clear eyes....</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">You scoff, but love is very serious....</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

Arranged by grave-faced parents with stately rites;<br />
Yawns are serious and so is repletion.<br />

<p class="noidt">Oh, do not take it ill. I say it but in jest,<br />
Merely because I like to laugh at the abyss,<br />
What do you think, poet?<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Well, marquise, I must confess</span><br />
That I am capable of feeling various loves.<br />

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">No, I was born for various sorrows.</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Or, by the same token, for various pleasures.</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Sheer vanity! Women always presume<br />
That their mere earthly presence gives men pleasure.<br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">You are clear-witted</span><br />

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shame restrains them.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">But what has shame to do with poetry?<br />
It has no worth, it is a social value,<br />
Value of a marquise, par excellence.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">None the less, shame is a resigned and subtle justice,<br />
The justice of women, poet.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which is no justice at all.</span><br />

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I know well what I wish....</span><br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Well then, we wish that it should not be merely a consonant.</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">No, rather that it should be poetry.</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Suppose that it were so, would it content you?</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">It is enough for me, and yet I fear<br />
That this pale poetry, untried, unlived,<br />
Can have no driving urge.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Why then should we refuse to live it?</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">I shall tell you. It is not in high-born taste<br />
To trifle with a heart.<br />
The love of a marquise is the problematic<br />
Love of elegance and froth,<br />
And like other love a sort of mathematic<br />
Love of addition, subtraction and division.<br />
It is not rude passion, fierce, emphatic,<br />
Song and orchestral counterpoint of life.<br />
It is what the world would name platonic,<br />
Love without fire, without virility,<br />
With nothing of creation, nothing tonic,<br />
One-step love, love of society.<br />
And I will have none of this love sardonic,<br />
None of its desperate futility.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">I do not fear you though you are a poet,<br />
And I say things to you, no other ears would endure.<br />
You were not born, poor anchorite,<br />
To say to a woman: "Be mine."<br />
And such is your secret vanity,<br />
You are a servile vassal of your own Utopia.<br />
You pretend to transform women<br />
Into laurel branches meaningless,<br />
And with your cynic's blare<br />
You thread upon the needle of your pride<br />
Dregs from the utter depths of the abyss.<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Marquise, a poet's love has led you astray.</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Marquise.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">Oh, don't be vain and fanciful. I swear<br />
That in my placid life, happiness brings no joy.<br />
What I longed for was a love, profound and mature,<br />
The profound love of a poet come to being,<br />
And not the incongruities of adolescence in verse....<br />
The radiant synthesis of a pungent existence<br />
And not the disloyalties of a dispersed dream.<br />
What woman has not dreamed of loving a poet<br />
Who would be conqueror and conquered all in one?<br />
What woman has not wished to be humble and forgiving<br />
With the man who sings the great passions he has known?<br />
We need you poets.... We are tormented by the desire<br />
Of a harmonious life, filled with deep sound,<br />
With the vigor and strength of wine poured out<br />
Into bowls of truths, deep with the depth of death.<br />
We crave no water, lymphatic, pure,<br />
In glasses of wind, frail as life.<br />
Better the vintage of the rich<br />
Served in vile glasses of gold. And if the mind be coarse,<br />
Perchance the hands will glitter with many stones.<br />
And if I may not have a fragrant and well-ordered nest<br />
Filled with clear rhythm and little blond heads,<br />
Then let me have my palace where luxurious pleasure<br />
Lends to love of earth, grief and deep dismay.<br />
Why do you not love living, poets? Why is it,<br />
The dullard who nor loves nor lives poaches your kisses?<br />
</p>

<p class="pchar"><span class="smcap">Poet.</span></p>

<p class="noidt">I do not comprehend, marquise. Why love living,<br />
If that is to live loving? We know that life and love<br />
Are wings forever fledging out<br />
In a bird neither swan nor hawk.<br />
I am resigned to my unequal destiny, for I know<br />
That my two eyes cannot perceive the same color.<br />
For even when there is calm, anxiety arises<br />
And then, I am not master, not even of my pain.<br />
I would be your friend, but there are obstacles,<br />
Captious dynamics, that put a check upon my words.<br />
I yield to the dumb pride of my huge torment,<br />
The song without words, the sonorous silence,<br />
And I do not desire any one to penetrate<br />
The garden wherein flowers the mystery I adore.<br />
</p>

<p>[<i>A stylish drawing-room. There are
doors at the back, and on each side.
Down-stage to the right is a window;
near it, but protected by a screen, is a
large arm-chair near a sewing-table.
Down-stage opposite is a fire-place, on
each side of which, facing it, are a sofa
and another large arm-chair; next the
sofa is a small table, and next to it, in
turn, a stool and two chairs. This part
of the stage should be so arranged as to
make a little cozy-corner. The set is
completed by various and sundry lamps,
vases with flowers, and the like.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, the servant enters
to Lamblin, Marthe and Madame
Bail, bringing coffee and cigarettes,
which he lays on the small table.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>settling comfortably into
his chair</i>]. Ah, how comfortable it is!
Mm&mdash;! [<i>To Marthe.</i>] Serve us our
coffee, my child, serve us our coffee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Always something
going round and round in that little head
of hers! Needn't worry about it&mdash;nothing
serious.&mdash;Well, Mother-in-law, what
do you say to the laces, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Delicious! It must
have cost a small fortune! You have
twenty yards there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Five thousand francs! Five
thousand francs! [<i>To Marthe.</i>] Yes,
madame, your husband was particularly
generous. He insists upon making his
wife the most beautiful of women and
giving her everything her heart desires.
Has he succeeded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Thank you. I've really never
seen such lovely malines. Madame Pertuis
ordered some lately and they're not
nearly so beautiful as these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> I'm glad to hear it. Well,
aren't you going to kiss your husband&mdash;for
his trouble? [<i>She kisses him.</i>]
Good! There, now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail</span> [<i>to Lamblin</i>]. You
spoil her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>to Marthe</i>]. Do I spoil you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Yes, yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> That's right. Everybody
happy? That's all we can ask, isn't that
so, Mamma Bail? Take care, I warn
you! If you continue to look at me that
way I'm likely to become dangerous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Silly man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail</span> [<i>to Marthe</i>]. Laugh,
why don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>bringing his wife to him and
putting her upon his knee</i>]. No, no, but
you don't laugh enough, little one. Now,
to punish you, I'm going to give you another
kiss. [<i>He kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Oh! Your beard pricks so!
Now, take your coffee, or it'll get cold,
and then you'll scold Julie again. [<i>A
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> It looks like pleasant
weather to-morrow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> What made you think
of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> The particles of sugar have
all collected at the bottom of my cup.
[<i>He drinks his coffee.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> As a matter of fact, I
hope the weather will be nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Do you have to go out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> I must go to Argentuil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Now, my dear mother-in-law,
what are you going to do at Argentuil?
I have an idea that there must be
some old general there&mdash;?</p>

<p>MADAME BAIL [<i>ironically</i>]. Exactly!
How would you like it if&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Don't joke about such
things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> You needn't worry!
Catch me marrying again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. There is a great
deal to be said for the happiness of married
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> For the men!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> For every one. Is not the
hearth a refuge, a sacred spot, where
both man and woman find sweet rest
after a day's work? Deny it, Mother.
Here we are, the three of us, each doing
what he likes to do, in our comfortable
little home, talking together happily.
The mind is at rest, and the heart quiet.
Six years of family life have brought us
security in our affection, and rendered
us kind and indulgent toward one another.
It is ineffably sweet, and brings
tears to the eyes. [<i>He starts to take a
sip of cognac.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>preventing him</i>]. Especially
when one is a little&mdash;lit up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Marthe, that's not at
all nice of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>to Madame Bail</i>]. Ah,
you're the only one who understands me,
Mother! Now, little one, you're going
to give me a cigar, one of those on the
table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>giving him a cigar</i>]. Lazy!
He can't even stretch his arm out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You see, I prefer to have
my little wife serve me and be nice to
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail</span> [<i>looking at them both</i>].
Shall I go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Why should you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Well&mdash;because&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>understanding</i>]. Oh! No,
no, stay with us and tell us stories. The
little one is moody and severe, I don't
dare risk putting my arm around her.
Her religion forbids her&mdash;expanding!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Then you don't think
I'll be in the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You, Mother! I tell you,
the day I took it into my head to bring
you here to live with us, I was an extremely
clever man. It's most convenient
to have you here. Men of business
like me haven't the time to spend all
their leisure moments with their wives.
Very often, after a day's work at the
office, I'm not at liberty to spend the evening
at home: I must return to the office,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> As you did yesterday!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> As I did yesterday. And
when I take it into my head to stroll
along the boulevard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Or elsewhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You insist on your little
joke, Mother. If, I say, I take it into
my head to go out, there's the little one
all alone. You came here to live with
us, and now my conscious is easy: I
leave my little wife in good hands. I
need not worry. There were a thousand
liberties I never indulged in before you
came. Now I take them without the
slightest scruple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> How kind of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Don't you think so, little
one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> I believe that Mamma did
exactly the right thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You see, I want people to
be happy. It is not enough that I should
be: every one must be who is about me.
I can't abide selfish people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> You're right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> And it's so easy not to be!
[<i>A pause.</i>] There is only one thing
worrying me now: I brought a whole
package of papers with me from the office,
which I must sign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> How is business now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Not very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Did M. Pacot reimburse
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Yes, did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> It's been pretty hard these
past three days, but I am reimbursed,
and that's all I ask. Now I'm going to
sign my papers. It won't take me more
than a quarter of an hour. I'll find you
here when I come back, shan't I? [<i>To
Marthe.</i>] And the little one will leave
me my cognac, eh? See you soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Yes, see you soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>to Marthe</i>]. You'll let me
have my cognac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> No! It's ridiculous! It'll
make you ill. [<i>Lamblin goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> There's a good boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> You always stand up for
him. The world is full of "good boys"
of his sort. "Good boys"! They're all
selfish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Don't get so excited!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> I'm not in the least excited.
I'm as calm now as I was excited a year
ago when I learned of Alfred's affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> No, you don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> You didn't behave at
all reasonably, as you ought to have done
long since. You still have absurd romantic
ideas. You're not at all reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>very much put out</i>]. Well,
if I still have those absurd ideas, if I
rebel at times, if, as you say, I'm unreasonable,
whom does it harm but me
alone? What do you expect? The bare
idea of sharing him is repulsive to me.
Think of it a moment&mdash;how perfectly
abominable it all is! Why, we are practically
accomplices! I thought we were
going to discuss it with him just now!
It will happen, I know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> What do you intend to
do about it? You keep on saying the
same thing. I'm an experienced woman.
Why don't you take my word, and be a
philosopher, the way all women are, the
way I've had to be more than once? If
you think for one moment that your own
father&mdash;! Well, we won't say anything
about him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Philosopher, philosopher! A
nice way to put it! In what way is that
Mathilde Cog&eacute;, who is his mistress, better
than I? I'd like to know that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> In any event, he might
have done much worse. She is a widow,
a woman of the world, and she isn't ruining
him. I know her slightly; I've seen
her at Madame Parent's. She just seems
a little mad, and not in the least spiteful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>raging</i>]. Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> But what are you going
to do about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> It would be best to separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Why didn't you think
of that sooner? You know very well
you'd be sorry the moment you'd done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Don't you think that would
be best for us all? What am I doing
here? What hopes have I for the future?
Merely to complete the happiness
of Monsieur, who deigns to see in me an
agreeable nurse, who occasionally likes
to rest by my side after his escapades
elsewhere! Thank you so much! I
might just as well go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> That would be madness.
You wouldn't be so foolish as to
do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Yes&mdash;I know&mdash;society
would blame me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> That's the first point.
We should submit to everything rather
than do as some others do and fly in the
face of convention. We belong to society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> In that case I should at
least have peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Peace! Nothing of
the sort, my dear. You know very well,
you would have regrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. What regrets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> God knows! Perhaps,
though you don't know it, you still love
him, in some hidden corner of your heart.
You may pity him. You can go a long
way with that feeling. Perhaps you have
same vague hope&mdash;[<i>Marthe is about to
speak.</i>] Well, we won't say any more
about that. And then you are religious,
you have a big forgiving soul. Aren't
these sufficient reasons for waiting? You
may regret it. Believe me, my dear
child. [<i>Marthe stands silent, and Madame
Bail changes her attitude and tone
of voice.</i>] Now, you must admit, you
haven't so much to complain of. Your
husband is far from the worst; indeed,
he's one of the best. What would you
do if you were in Madame Ponceau's
position? Her husband spends all their
money and stays away for two and three
months at a time. He goes away, is not
seen anywhere, and when he returns, he
has the most terrible scenes with poor
Marie, and even beats her! Now, Alfred
is very good to you, pays you all
sorts of attentions, he comes home three
evenings a week, gives you all sorts of
presents. And these laces! He never
bothers you or abuses you. See how nice
he was just a few minutes ago, simple
and natural! He was lovely, and said
the pleasantest imaginable things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. He flattered you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> That isn't the reason!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> That you say nice things
about him? Nonsense! He pleases and
amuses you. You don't want me to apply
for a separation because you want
him near you, and because you are afraid
of what people will say. Be frank and
admit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Marthe, that's not at
all nice of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> It's the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> No, no, nothing of the
sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Another thing that grates
on me in this life we are leading is to see
the way my mother takes her son-in-law's
part against me. You find excuses
for him on every occasion; and your one
fear seems to be that he should hear
some random word that will wound him;
and the proof is that he never interrupts
one of our conversations&mdash;which are always
on the same subject&mdash;but that you
don't fail to make desperate signs to me
to keep still!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> What an idea!
[<i>Marthe is about to reply, when Madame
Bail perceives Lamblin re&euml;ntering,
and signs to Martha to say nothing
more.</i>] It's he! [<i>Marthe shrugs her
shoulders.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Lamblin.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>joyfully</i>]. There, that's
done. One hundred and two signatures.
Kiss me, little one. In less than an hour
I've earned a thousand francs for us.
Isn't that splendid?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter a servant.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Monsieur?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Some one&mdash;from
the office&mdash;who wishes to speak
with Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> From the office? At this
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Yes, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Say that I am with my
family, and that I am not receiving any
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> That is what I said, but the&mdash;person&mdash;insists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> How annoying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> See him, dear, Marthe
and I will go out and you may see him
here. No one will disturb you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Yes, it's best to see him!
[<i>They make ready to go out; pick up
their work, and so on.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>to the servant</i>]. Tell him to
come in. [<i>The servant goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>to Madame Bail, as she
points after the servant</i>]. Did you notice?
Adolphe was very embarrassed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Now what are you going
to worry about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> I tell you, I saw it! [<i>The
women go out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> This is too much! Not a
moment of peace!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Madame Cog&eacute;.</i>]</p>

<p>You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> What do you think of
my trick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Detestable as well as dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Come, come. I wanted
to go to the <i>Bouffes</i>, and I wanted you
to go with me. It's nine o'clock, but
we'll be in time for the principal play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> No, no, no, impossible.
And what do you mean by falling upon
me this way without warning! My dear
Mathilde, what were you thinking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> I decided this morning.
You were so nice yesterday!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You must go at once!
What if some one found you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Your wife? Quick,
then, we must be going. Take your hat,
say good-by. I'll wait for you downstairs.
I have a cab. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> I tell you, it's out of the
question. Go alone. I have a headache&mdash;I've
smoked too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> You refuse? And I
was looking forward so&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Now, listen to me, my dear:
I have told you once for all, I'm not a
rounder. I like everything well regulated.
I have my own little habits, and
I don't like something to come along and
upset everything. I'm very much of a
family man, I've often impressed that
fact upon you, and I'm astonished, perfectly
astonished, that you don't take
that into account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;</span> [<i>in a high voice</i>]. You
make me tired. So there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Don't scream so! I tell
you, I wouldn't go out to-night for anything
under the sun. Yesterday, Heaven
knows, I was only too happy to be with
you: we enjoyed ourselves; it was most
pleasant. As for this evening&mdash;no: to-morrow.
We decided on Mondays,
Wednesday, Fridays, and a Sunday from
time to time. I have no wish to alter
that schedule. I'm regulated like a
cuckoo clock. You don't seem to believe
that. I strike when I'm intended
to strike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> That is as much as to
say that you like me three days a week,
and the rest of the time I mean as little
to you as the Grand Turk! That's a
queer kind of love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Not at all. I think of you
very often, and if you were to disappear,
I should miss you a great deal.
Only it's a long way between that and
disturbing my equilibrium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> And I suppose you
love your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Are you jealous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> I am, and I have reason
to be be....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> How childish of you! You
know very well that you are the only
woman, only&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Ah, there is an
"only"!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Yes,&mdash;only, just because I
love you is no reason why I should feel
no affection for her, and that you should
treat her as you do! She is so devoted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> What is there so extraordinary
about her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>becoming excited</i>]. She does
for me what others would not do&mdash;you
for instance! She has a steady affection
for me; I keep it for my bad moments;
her action doesn't turn in every wind.
You should see her, so resigned, so
anxious to do everything for my comfort
and convenience! She's worried when I
have a headache, she runs for my slippers
when I come home in wet weather&mdash;from
your house! [<i>Deeply moved.</i>] You
see that cognac there? That was the
second glass I poured out for myself this
evening; the moment I started to drink
it her little hand stretched forth and
took it from me, because she said I would
make myself ill! [<i>He starts to weep.</i>]
You know, I poured it out just in order
that she should prevent my drinking it.
These things stir the heart! [<i>A pause.</i>]
Now you must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> No, no. I love you,
and I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You are selfish. And you
know I can't stand selfish people. You
want to deprive me of a quiet evening in
the bosom of my family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> I want you to love me,
and me alone. I want you to leave your
home if need be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Yes, and if I were to fall
sick&mdash;which might happen, though I
have a strong constitution, thank God!&mdash;I
know you. You're the best woman
in the world, but that doesn't prevent
your being a little superficial!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Superficial!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Yes, you are, and you can't
deny it! Your dropping in on me, like
a bolt from the blue, proves it conclusively.
And when you once begin chattering
about yourself, about your dresses,
oh, my! You never stop. You can't be
serious, your conversation is not the sort
that pleases a man, flatters and amuses
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> You never talk about <i>him</i>!
One night I remember, I was a little sick
and you sent me home. <i>There</i> they made
tea for me. The cook was already in bed,
and Marthe didn't hesitate an instant to
go to the kitchen and soil her hands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> When was that? When
was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> For God's sake, don't scream
so! Not more than two weeks ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> You didn't say what
was the matter with you, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> I complained enough,
Heaven knows. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Then you won't come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;</span> [<i>resolutely</i>]. Very well,
then, farewell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Now, you mustn't get
angry. [<i>He puts his arm round her
waist</i>]. You know I can't do without
you. You are always my dear little Mathilde,
my darling little girl. Aren't
you? Do you remember yesterday, eh?
You know I love you&mdash;deeply?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> On Mondays, Wednesdays,
Fridays, and from time to time on
Sundays. Thanks! [<i>She starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Mathilde!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Good evening. [<i>Returning
to him.</i>] Do you want me to tell
you something? Though I may be superficial,
<i>you</i> are a selfish egotist, and you
find your happiness in the tears and suffering
of those who love you! Good-by!
[<i>She starts to go again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Mathilde, Mathilde, dear!
To-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;</span> [<i>returning</i>]. Do you
want me to tell you something else?
When a man is married and wants to have
a mistress, he would do much better and
act more uprightly to leave his wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>simply</i>]. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Cog&eacute;.</span> Why?&mdash;Good evening!
[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Mathilde, Mathilde! Did I
make her angry? Oh, she'll forget it all
in a quarter of an hour. My, what a
headache! [<i>Catching sight of Marthe,
who enters from the right.</i>] Marthe!
She looks furious! She saw Mathilde go
out! What luck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>furiously</i>]. Who was that
who just left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Why&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Who was that who just left?
Answer me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> It was&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> Madame Cog&eacute;, wasn't it?
Don't lie, I saw her! What can you be
thinking of? To bring your mistress
here! I don't know what's prevented my
going away before, and leaving you to
your debauchery! This is the end&mdash;understand?
I've had enough. You're
going to live alone from now on. [<i>He
starts to speak.</i>] Alone. Good-by, monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>moved</i>]. Marthe! [<i>She
dashes out. Lamblin goes to the door
through which Marthe has gone.</i>] Marthe,
Marthe, little one! Tell me that you
forgive me. [<i>Coming down-stage.</i>] It's
all up! Good Lord!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Madame Bail.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>goes to her, nearly in tears</i>].
Oh, Mother, all is lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> No, no, you great
child! I know everything, and I promise
it will be all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> No, no, I tell you. Marthe
told me she wanted to leave me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Now, don't carry on
that way. I don't want to see you cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> But how can I be calm
when my whole future is ruined?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Nothing of the sort.
Don't you think I know my own daughter?
She is too well educated, she has
too much common sense, to leave you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>a little consoled</i>]. You
think so? Oh, if that were only true!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> But it is true! She's
crying now; her tears will ease her, and
make her change her mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Yes, yes, let her cry, let her
cry all she wants to!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> I tell you she is yours;
she loves you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>brightening</i>]. Is that true?
[<i>Madame Bail nods.</i>] How happy I am!
[<i>A pause. His attitude changes.</i>] But
there's one thing that troubles me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. No, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Confide in me. Tell
me. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Well, that lady who came
here this evening&mdash;I'm afraid I was a
little short with her. I think I offended
her. I practically showed her the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> Don't worry about
that. Perhaps you weren't so rude as you
thought you were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> No, I'm sure. I know very
well that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> You mustn't worry and
get all excited&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin.</span> Do you know anything
about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> No, nothing, only&mdash;as
I rather suspected what was going on in
here&mdash;and was afraid&mdash;of a quarrel&mdash;I
met her as she was going out, and I&mdash;spoke
to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>taking her hands&mdash;joyfully</i>].
I thank you! [<i>They are both
embarrassed for a moment, then sit
down.</i>]  Ah, good. Well, and Marthe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail</span> [<i>pointing to Marthe who
enters</i>]. There she is. What did I tell
you? [<i>Marthe enters without saying a
word. She brings her work, Madame
Bail takes up hers, and sits next her. A
pause. Madame Bail speaks to Marthe.</i>]
What a pretty design! Where did you
find the pattern?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe.</span> I just picked it up at the
store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame Bail.</span> It's charming. I must
get one like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>ill at ease</i>]. May I see it,
little one? [<i>Marthe unrolls the embroidery
for him and shows it.</i>] Oh, it's perfectly
lovely! We men would be hard
put to it to make anything half as beautiful!
[<i>He laughs awkwardly, and pours
out some cognac, in full sight of Marthe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marthe</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. That's ridiculous,
Alfred. [<i>Then she says slowly, as she
lowers her eyes.</i>] You'll make yourself
ill!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamblin</span> [<i>in perfect contentment</i>].
How charming she is!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>A studio. At the back is a door opening
upon a garden; doors to the right and
left; likewise a small inconspicuous door
to the left. There are a few pictures on
easels. The table is littered with papers,
books, weapons, bric-a-brac. Chairs and
sofas. It is eleven o'clock in the morning.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>a small, frail woman, with
a melancholy look, at times rather mocking.
As the curtain rises she is alone.
She raises and lowers the window-blind
from time to time</i>]. A little more!
There! Oh, the sunlight! How blinding!
[<i>Glancing at the studio with satisfaction.</i>]
How neat everything is! [<i>In
attempting to take something from the
table, she knocks some papers to the
floor.</i>] Well! [<i>Seeing a letter, among
the papers she is picking up.</i>] A letter!
From Monsieur Gu&eacute;rin&mdash;[<i>Reading.</i>]
"My dear friend, why do you persist in
keeping silence? You say very little of
the imprudent woman who has dared to
become the companion of the handsome
Marcel! Do you recompense her for her
confidence in you, for her courage? You
are not at all like other men: your frivolity,
if you will permit the term,
your&mdash;" [<i>Interrupting herself.</i>] He
writes the word! [<i>Continuing.</i>] "Your
cynicism makes me tremble for you. Absent
for a year! How much friendship
gone to waste! Why were we thrust
apart the moment you were married?
Why did my wife's health make sunlight
an absolute necessity for her? We are
now leaving Rome; in a month I'll drop
in on you at Auteuil&mdash;" [<i>Interrupting
herself again.</i>] Very soon!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Marcel appears at the back.</i>]</p>

<p>"I am very impatient to see you, and
Very anxious to see Madame Desroches.
I wonder whether she will take to me?
I hope she will. Take care, you villain,
I shall cross-question her carefully, and
if I find the slightest shadow upon her
happiness, her friend-to-be will be an
angry man." [<i>She stops reading and
says to herself, sadly.</i>] A friend&mdash;I
should like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>carelessly dressed. He is of
the type that appeals to women</i>]. Ah,
inquisitive, you read my letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh, it's an old one&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>chaffing her</i>]. From Gu&eacute;rin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I found it there, when I
was putting the studio in order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. The little romantic
child is looking for a friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I have so much to tell, so
much about my recent happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Am I not that friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You are the man I love.
Should I consult with you, where your
happiness is concerned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Too deep for me! [<i>Yawning.</i>]
Oh, I'm tired!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Did you come in late last
night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Three o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You were very quiet, you
naughty man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Were you jealous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> The idea! I am morally
certain that you love no one except your
wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. It's true, I love no
one except my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>chaffing him in turn</i>].
Poor Marcel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span>  I was bored to death at that
supper; I can't imagine why.&mdash;They all
tell me I'm getting stout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> That's no reason why you
shouldn't please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> God is very unjust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> So they say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>stretching out on a sofa</i>].
Excuse my appearance, won't you, Fran&ccedil;oise?
[<i>Making himself comfortable.</i>]
I can't keep my eyes open any longer
nowadays. The days of my youth&mdash;Why,
I was&mdash;[<i>He stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You were just the right
age for marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>as if to banish the idea</i>]. Oh!
[<i>A pause.</i>] I'm sure you will get along
well with Gu&eacute;rin. Yours are kindred
spirits&mdash;you're alike&mdash;not in looks, however.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Morally, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Yes, The comparison flatters
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> He's like this, then; sentimental,
a good friend, and a man of
honor. Yes, I think I shall get along
nicely with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> What a sympathetic nature
you have! You've never seen him, and
you know him already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> How long has he been
married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> He was born married!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Ten years, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> He's happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> What sort of woman is
she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Lively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Though virtuous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> So they say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then Madame Gu&eacute;rin and
the handsome Martel&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> A friend's wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> It's very tempting&mdash;[<i>Marcel
seems to take this with ill-humor;
he is about to put on his hat.</i>]
Are you going out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I lunch at the club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm&mdash;a little nervous; I need
a breath of air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Paris air!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> And your work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm not in the mood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> It's only ten days before
the Salon: you'll never be ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> What chance have I, with my
talent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You have a great deal of
talent&mdash;it's recognized everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I did have.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Will you be home for dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Of course! And
don't allow any black suspicion to get
the better of you: I'm not lunching with
anybody!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I suspect you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>gratefully</i>]. 'Til later, then!
[<i>A pause. Frankly.</i>] Of course, I don't
always go where I tell you I'm going.
Why should I worry you? But if you
think I&mdash;do what I ought not to do, you
are mistaken. I'm no longer a bachelor,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Just a trifle, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> No jealousy, dear! The day
of adventures is dead and buried. Thirty-five
mortal years, a scarcity of hair, a
noticeable rotundity&mdash;and married!
Opportunities are fewer now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>playfully</i>]. Don't lose
courage, your luck may return. A minute
would suffice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>mournfully</i>]. I don't dare
hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Married! It was never
your destiny to be a proprietor, you are
doomed to be a tenant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>as he is about to leave, sees
a letter on the table</i>]. Oh, a letter, and
you said nothing to me about it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I didn't see it. Jean must
have brought it while you were asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> From Passy! I know that
hand! [<i>Aside, with surprise.</i>] Madame
Gu&eacute;rin&mdash;Madeleine! Well! [<i>Reading.</i>]
"My dear friend I lunch to-day with
my aunt Madame de Monglat, at La
Muette&mdash;as I used to. Come and see
me before noon, I have serious things to
discuss with you." [<i>He stops reading;
aside, much pleased.</i>] A rendezvous!
And after three years! Poor Gu&eacute;rin!
No! It wouldn't be decent now! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>aside</i>]. He seems to be
waking up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>aside</i>]. They must have returned!
Fran&ccedil;oise was right&mdash;a minute
would suffice! The dear girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> No bad news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>in spite of himself</i>]. On the
contrary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. It's from that
American woman who saw my picture
the other day&mdash;at Goupil's, you remember?
She insists that I give it to her for
ten thousand francs. I really think I'll
let her have it. Nowadays you never
can tell&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I think you would be very
wise to sell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>handing her the letter</i>].
Don't you believe me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Marcel puts the letter in his pocket.
A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>hesitating before he leaves;
aside</i>]. She's a darling; a perfect little
darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then you're not going
out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Do you want to
send me away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> If you're going out to
lunch, you had better hurry&mdash;the train
leaves in a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>suddenly affectionate</i>]. How
can I hurry when you are so charming?
You're adorable this morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> D'you think so?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Curious, but every
time I have a rendezvous, she is like
that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Good-by, then; I've had
enough of you! If you stay you'll upset
all my plans. I'd quite made up my
mind to be melancholy and lonely. It's
impossible to be either gay or sad with
you! Run along!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>taking off his hat, which he
had put on some moments before</i>]. I
tell you this is my house, and this my
studio. Your house is there by the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Yes, it's only there that
you are my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Oh! [<i>Reproachfully, and
with tenderness.</i>] Tell me, Fran&ccedil;oise,
why don't you ever want to go out with
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You know I don't like society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm seen so much alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> So much the better
for you; you will be taken for a
bachelor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> One might think the way you
talk, that husband and wife ought never
to live together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Perhaps I'd see you
oftener if we weren't married!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Isn't it a pleasure to you,
Madame, to be in the arms of your husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Isn't it likewise a pleasure
to be able to say, "He is free, I am not
his wife, he is not my husband; I am not
his duty, a millstone around his neck; I
am his avocation, his love? If he leaves
me, I know he is tired of me, but if
he comes back, then I know he loves
me"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Fran&ccedil;oise, you are an extremist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I know your philosophy is
nothing but love. [<i>A pause.</i>] You cry
sometimes, don't you? When I'm not
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Just a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I make you very unhappy!
When you are sad, don't conceal it from
me, Fran&ccedil;oise; one of your tears would
make me do anything in the world for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> One, yes! But, many?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Don't make fun of me: I am
serious. If I told you that my affection
for you is as great as yours, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You would be lying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Perhaps! But I think I
adore you! Every time I leave you, I
feel so lonely; I wander about like a lost
soul! I think something must be happening
to you. And when I come home
at midnight, and open the door, I feel an
exquisite sensation&mdash;Is that love? You
ought to know&mdash;you are an adept!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>unthinkingly</i>]. You know,
Fran&ccedil;oise, one can never be sure of one's
self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> No one can say, "I love to-day,
and I shall love to-morrow." You
or any one else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>offended</i>]. I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> How can you tell, whether in
fifteen years&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh, I'm a little child&mdash;I'm
different from the others: I shall
always love the same man all his life.
But go on, you were saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Nothing. I want you to be
happy, in spite of everything, no matter
what may happen&mdash;no matter what I
may do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Even if you should deceive
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Deceive you?
Never! I care nothing about other
women! You are my happiness&mdash;not a
mere pastime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Alas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Why alas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Because it is easier to do
without happiness than pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Oh, you are all
that is highest and best in my life. I
prefer you to everything else! Let a
woman come between us, and she shall
have me to deal with! Call it selfishness,
if you will, or egotism&mdash;but your peace
of mind is an absolute necessity to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You need not prepare me
for the future, you bad boy: I resigned
myself to "possibilities" some time ago.
I'm inexperienced and young in years,
but I'm older than you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Shall I tell you something?
I never deserved you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> That's true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> When I think how happy you
might have made some good and worthy
man, and that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Who then would have
made me happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are not happy now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I didn't marry for happiness;
I married in order to have you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm a fool! It would be
nice, wouldn't it, if I were an unfaithful
husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I'm sure you will never be
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Do you really think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I am positive. What
would be the use in deceiving me? I
should be so unhappy, and you wouldn't
be a bit happier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> No, you will not deceive
me. To begin with, I have great luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>gayly</i>]. Of course, you have;
you don't know how much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>coquettishly</i>]. Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> What a child you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I should think so! Sometimes
I imagine that my happiness does
not lie altogether in those sparkling eyes
of yours and I try to fall in love with
another woman; I fall in deeper and
deeper for a week or two, and think I
am terribly infatuated. But just as I
am about to take the fatal leap, I fail:
Fran&ccedil;oise' luck, you see! At bottom,
I'm a commencer; I can't imagine what
it is that saves me&mdash;and you. Sometimes
<i>she</i> has done something to displease
me, sometimes a divine word from your
lips&mdash;and a mere nothing, something
quite insignificant! For instance, Wednesday,
I missed the train, and came
back and had dinner with you. You see,
Fran&ccedil;oise' luck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then you're not going out
to-day, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Nor to-morrow; the whole
day is yours. We'll close the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Aren't you happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>kissing her behind the ear</i>].
Hurry up, you lazy child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I'm not pretty, but I have
my good points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Not pretty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> No, but I deserve to be.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Madeleine appears at the back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I beg your pardon!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Fran&ccedil;oise gives an exclamation of
surprise and escapes through the
door to the right without looking
again at the visitor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Madeleine!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine</span> [<i>stylishly dressed. With
an air of bravura</i>]. So this is the way
you deceive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>gayly</i>]. My dear, if you think
that during these three years&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I beg your pardon for interrupting
your little <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, Marcel,
but your door was open, and there was
no servant to announce me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You know you are always
welcome here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Your wife is very attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Isn't she? Shall I introduce
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Later&mdash;I've come to see
<i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I must confess your visit is a
little surprising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Especially after my sending
that note this morning. I thought I
should prefer not to trouble you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>uncertain</i>]. Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Well, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm  sorry. [<i>Kissing her
hand.</i>] Glad to see you, at any rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Same studio as always,
eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are still as charming as
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You are as handsome as
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I can say no less for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I'm only twenty-eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> But your husband is fifty:
that keeps you young. How long have
you been back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> A week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> And I haven't seen Gu&eacute;rin
yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> There's no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> He's a bit worried: you
know how jealous he is! Well, yesterday,
when I was out, he went through all
my private papers&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Naturally he came across
some letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> <i>The</i> letters, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Yes. [<i>Gesture from Marcel.</i>]
Old letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You kept them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> From a celebrity? Of
course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> The devil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Ungrateful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You can imagine my explanation
following the discovery. My
dear Marcel, there's going to be a divorce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> A&mdash;! A divorce?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Don't feel too sorry for
me. After all, I shall be free and almost
happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> What resignation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Only&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Only what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> He is going to send you
his seconds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>gayly</i>]. A duel? To-day?
You're not serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I think he wants to kill
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> But that affair was three
years ago! Why, to begin with, he hasn't
the right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Because it was so long
ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Three years is three years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You're right: <i>now</i> you are
not in love with his wife: you love your
own. Time has changed everything.
Now your own happiness is all-sufficient.
I can easily understand your indignation
against my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Oh, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> My husband is slow, but
he's sure, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You're cruel, Madeleine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> If it's ancient history for
you, it's only too recent for him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Let's not speak about him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> But he ought to be a very
interesting topic of conversation just
now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I hadn't foreseen his feeling
so keenly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You must tell him how
sorry you are when you see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> At the duel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Elsewhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Where? Here, in my house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> My dear, he may want to
tell you how he feels.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>aside, troubled</i>]. The devil!
And Fran&ccedil;oise? [<i>Another pause.</i>] Oh,
a duel! Well, I ought to risk my life for
you; you have done the same thing for
me many times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Oh, I was not so careful
as you were then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are not telling me everything,
Madeleine. What put it into your
husband's head to look through your
papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Well, evidently <i>I</i> couldn't
have excited his jealousy. For a long
time he has had no reason to suspect
me! Were they my letters he was looking
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> That is my affair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Then I am expiating for
some one else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I'm afraid so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Perfect!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>reproachfully</i>]. So you are
deceiving him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You are a perfect friend
to-day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Then you really have a lover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> A second lover! That
would be disgraceful, wouldn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> The first step always brings
the worst consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> What are you smiling at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Oh, the happiness of others!
Well, let's have no bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> No, you might feel remorse!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Oh, Madeleine, why am I not
the guilty one this time? You are always
so beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Your fault! You should
have kept what you had!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I thought you were tired of
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You will never know what
I suffered; I cried like an abandoned
shopgirl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Not for long, though?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Three months. When I
think I once loved you so much, and here
I am before you so calm and indifferent!
You look like anybody else now. How
funny, how disgusting life is! You meet
some one, do no end of foolish and
wicked and mean things in order to belong
to him, and the day comes when
you don't know one another. Each takes
his turn! I think it would have been
better&mdash;[<i>Gesture from Marcel.</i>] Yes&mdash;I
ought to try to forget everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> That's all buried in the past!
Wasn't it worth the trouble, and the suffering
we have to undergo now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You, too! You have to
recall&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'm sorry, but I didn't begin
this conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Never mind! It's all
over, let's say no more about it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> No, please! Let's&mdash;curse
me, Madeleine say anything you like
about me: I deserve it all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Stop! Behave yourself,
married man! What if your wife heard
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> She? Dear child! She is
much too afraid of what I might say to
listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Dear child! You cynic!
I'll wager you have not been a model
husband since your marriage!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You are mistaken this time,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You are lying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Seriously; and I'm more surprised
than you at the fact&mdash;but it's
true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Poor Marcel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I do suffer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Then you are a faithful
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I am frivolous and&mdash;compromising&mdash;that
is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> It's rather funny: you
seem somehow to be ready to belong to
some one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Madeleine, you are the first
who has come near tempting me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Is it possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I feel myself weakening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Thank you so much for
thinking of me, dear; I appreciate it,
but for the time being, I'll&mdash;consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Have you made up your
mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> We shall see later; I'll
think it over&mdash;perhaps! Yet, I rather
doubt if&mdash;. You haven't been nice to
me to-day, your open honest face hasn't
pleased me at all. You're so carelessly
dressed! I don't think you're interesting
any more. No, I hardly think so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> But, Madeleine&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Don't call <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'be'">me</ins> Madeleine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Madame Gu&eacute;rin! Madame
Gu&eacute;rin! if I told you how much your
note meant to me! How excited I was!
I trembled when I read it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I'll warrant you read it
before your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> It was so charming of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> How depraved you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> How well you know me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I adore you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> That's merely a notion of
yours! You imagine, since you haven't
seen me for so long&mdash;I've just come
back from a long trip!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Don't shake my faith in you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Think of your duties, my
dear; don't forget&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> My children? I have none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Your wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>in desperation</i>]. You always
speak of her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Love her, my friend, and
if my husband doesn't kill you to-morrow,
continue to love her in peace and
quiet. You are made for a virtuous life
now&mdash;any one can see that. I flatter
you when I consider you a libertine.
You've been spoiled by too much happiness,
that's the trouble with you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>trying to kiss her</i>]. Madeleine,
if you only&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine</span> [<i>evading him</i>]. Are you
out of your wits?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Forgive me: I haven't quite
forgotten! Well, if I am killed it will
be for a good reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Poor dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> It will! This duel is going
to compromise you fearfully. Come
now, every one will accuse you to-morrow;
what difference does it make to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I'm not in the mood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Now <i>you</i> are lying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I don't love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Nonsense! You're sulking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> How childish! Don't
touch me! You want me to be unfaithful
to everybody! Never! [<i>Changing.</i>]
Yet&mdash;! No; it would be too foolish!
Good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>kissing her as she tries to
pass him</i>]. Not before&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Oh, you've mussed my
hat; how awkward of you! [<i>Trying to
escape from Marcel's embrace.</i>] Let me
go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>jokingly</i>]. Let you go? In
a few days!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Good-by. My husband
may come any moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Are you afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Yes, I'm afraid he might
forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> One minute more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> No! I have just time.
I'm going away this evening&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Going away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> To London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> With&mdash;<i>him</i>, the other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Who knows? He may be
waiting for you this moment at Madame
de Montglat's, your aunt's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> They are playing cards
together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> The way we are! What a
family!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Impudent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> That's why you came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine</span> [<i>about to leave</i>]. Shall I
go out through the models' door, as I
used to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> If I were still a bachelor
you wouldn't leave me this way! You
would miss your train this evening, I'll
tell you that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> You may very well look at
that long sofa! No, no, my dear: not to-day,
thanks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> In an hour, then, at Madame
de Montglat's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Take care, or I'll make
you meet your successor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Then I can see whether you
are still a woman of taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeleine.</span> Ah, men are very&mdash;I'll
say the word after I leave. [<i>She goes
out through the little door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>alone</i>]. "Men are very&mdash;!"
If we were, the women would have a
very stupid time of it!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He is about to follow Madeleine.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Fran&ccedil;oise.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Who was that stylish looking
woman who just left, Marcel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Madame
Jackson, my American friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> My picture? Sold!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Ten thousand? Splendid!
Don't you think so? You don't seem
very happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> The idea!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He picks up his hat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>jealously</i>]. Are you going
to leave me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I am just going to Goupil's
and tell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then I'll have to lunch
all by myself! [<i>Marcel stops an instant
before the mirror.</i>] You look
lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>turning round</i>]. I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh, you'll succeed!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>enchanted, in spite of himself</i>].
What can you be thinking of!
[<i>Aside.</i>] What if she were after all
my happiness? [<i>Reproachfully.</i>] Now,
Fran&ccedil;oise&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I was only joking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>ready to leave</i>]. No moping,
remember? I can't have that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly. He stands at the
threshold. Aside</i>]. Poor child! Well
I may fail!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out, left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Where is he going?
Probably to a rendezvous. Oh, if
he is! Will my luck fail me to-day?
Soon he'll come back again, so well satisfied
with himself! I talk to him so
much about my resignation, I wonder
whether he believes in it? Why must I
be tormented this way forever?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Jean, with a visiting-card.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean.</span> Is Monsieur here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Let me see!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She takes the card.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean.</span> The gentleman is waiting, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Ask him to come in.
Quick, now!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Jean goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Gu&eacute;rin, at the back. As he
sees Fran&ccedil;oise he hesitates before
coming to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>cordially</i>]. Come in, Monsieur.
I have never seen you, but I already
know you very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>a large, strong man, with
grayish hair</i>]. Thank you, Madame. I
thought I should find Monsieur Desroches
at home. If you will excuse
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I beg you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> I fear I am intruding: it's
so early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You intruding in Marcel's
home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Madame&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> My husband will return
soon, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>brightening</i>]. Good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Will you wait for him
here in the studio?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>advancing</i>]. Really, Madame,
it would be most ungrateful of me to
refuse your kindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Here are magazines and
newspapers&mdash;I shall ask to be excused.
[<i>As she is about to leave.</i>] It was
rather difficult to make you stay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Forgive me, Madame.
[<i>Aside ironically.</i>] Too bad! She's decidedly
charming!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Having gone up-stage, Fran&ccedil;oise
suddenly returns.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> It seems a little strange to
you, Monsieur&mdash;doesn't it?&mdash;to see a
woman in this bachelor studio&mdash;quite at
home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Why, Madame&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Before leaving you&mdash;which
I shall do in a moment&mdash;you must
know that there is one woman who is
very glad to know you have returned to
Paris!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> We just arrived this week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. It's so long since
I've seen Marcel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Three years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> So many things have happened
since!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You find him a married
man, for one thing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Happily married!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Yes, happily!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Dear old Marcel! I'll be so
glad to see him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I see you haven't forgotten
my husband, Monsieur. Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> How can I help admiring
so stout and loyal a heart as his!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You'll have to like me,
too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> I already do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Really? Then you believe
everything you write?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Yes, Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Take care! This morning
I was re-reading one of your letters, in
which you promised me your heartiest
support. [<i>Offering him her hand.</i>]
Then we're friends, are we not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>after hesitating, takes her
hand</i>]. Good friends, Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Word of honor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Word of honor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>sitting</i>]. Then I'll stay.
Sit down, and let's talk. [<i>Gu&eacute;rin is uncertain.</i>]
We have so much to say to
each other! Let's talk about you first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>forced to sit down</i>]. About
me? But I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Yes, about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. No, about <i>your</i>
happiness, your welfare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> About my great happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. Let us speak
about your&mdash;existence&mdash;with which you
are so content. I must know all the
happiness of this house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Happy people never have
anything to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> You never have troubles, I
presume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> None, so far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> But what might happen?
To-day you are living peacefully with
Marcel, a man whose marriage was, it
seems, strongly opposed. Life owes you
no more than it has already given you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> My happiness is complete.
I had never imagined that a
man's goodness could make a woman so
happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Goodness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Love, you mean Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh, Marcel's love for
me&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Something lacking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>interested</i>]. Tell me. Am I
not your friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Seriously, Monsieur, you
know him very well: how could he be in
love with me? Is it even possible? He
allows one to love him, and I ask nothing
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Only to be allowed to continue.
[<i>Gesture from Gu&eacute;rin.</i>] I am
not like other women. I don't ask for
rights; but I do demand tenderness, and
consideration. He is free, I am not&mdash;I'll
admit that. But I don't mind, I
only hope that we may continue as we
are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Have you some presentiment,
Madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I am afraid, Monsieur.
My happiness is not of the proud, demonstrative
variety, it is a kind of happiness
that is continually trembling for
its safety. If I told you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Do tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Later! How I pity any
one who loves and has to suffer for it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. You&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I am not on the side of
the jealous, of the betrayed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>aside, sympathetically</i>]. Poor
little woman! [<i>With great sincerity.</i>]
Then you are not sure of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>more and more excited</i>].
He is Marcel! Admit for a moment that
he loves me to-day&mdash;I want so to believe
it! To-morrow will he love me? Does
he himself know whether he will love me
then? Isn't he at the mercy of a whim,
a passing fancy&mdash;of the weather, or the
appearance of the first woman he happens
to meet? I am only twenty, and I
am not always as careful as I might be.
Happiness is so difficult!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Yes, it is. [<i>To himself.</i>] It
is! [<i>To Fran&ccedil;oise.</i>] Perhaps you are
conscientious, too sincere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I feel that; yes, I think I
am, but every time I try to hide my
affection from him, he becomes indifferent,
almost mean&mdash;as if he were glad
to be relieved of a duty&mdash;of being good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> So it's come to that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You see, Marcel can't get
used to the idea that his other life is
over, dead and buried, that he's married
for good&mdash;that he must do as others do.
I do my best and tell him, but my very
presence only reminds him of his duties
as a husband. For instance [<i>interrupting
herself</i>]. Here I am telling you all
this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Oh!&mdash;Please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. He likes to go
out alone at night, without me. He
knows me well enough to understand that
his being away makes me very unhappy,
and as a matter of form, of common
courtesy, he asks me to go with him. I
try to reason and convince myself that he
doesn't mean what he says, but I can't
help feeling sincerely happy when once
in a while I do accept his invitation.
But the moment we leave the house I
realize my mistake. Then he pretends
to be in high spirits, but I know all the
time he is acting a part; and when we
come home again he lets drop without
fail some hint about having lost his liberty;
he says he took me out in a moment
of weakness, that he really wanted
to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. And when he
does go out alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then I am most unhappy;
I'm in torment for hours and hours. I
wonder where he can be, and then I'm
afraid he won't come back at all. When
the door opens, when I hear him come
in, I'm so happy I pay no attention to
what he tells me. But I made a solemn
vow never to show the least sign of jealousy.
My face is always tranquil, and
what I say to him never betrays what I
feel. I never knowingly betray myself,
but his taking way, his tenderness, soon
make me confess every fear; then he
turns round and, using my own confession
as a weapon, shows me how wrong
I am to be afraid and suspicious. And
when sometimes I say nothing to him,
even when he tries to make me confess,
he punishes me most severely by telling
me stories of his affairs, narrow escapes,
and all his temptations. He once told
me about an old mistress of his, whom
he had just seen, a very clever woman,
who was never jealous! Or else he comes
in so late that I must be glad, for if he
came in later, it would have been all
night! He tells me he had some splendid
opportunity, and had to give it up! A
thousand things like that! He seems to
delight in making me suspect and doubt
him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Poor little woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> That's my life; as for my
happiness, it exists from day to day.
[<i>With determination.</i>] If I only had the
right to be unhappy! But I must always
smile, I must be happy, not only in
his presence, but to the very depths of
my soul! So that he may deceive me
without the least remorse! It is his
pleasure!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She bursts into tears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>rising</i>]. The selfish brute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Isn't my suffering a reproach
to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> I pity you, Madame, and I
think I understand you better than any
one else. I have trouble not unlike your
own; perhaps greater, troubles for which
there is no consolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> If you understand me,
Monsieur, advise me! I need you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>startled back into reality</i>].
Me, help you? I? [<i>Aside.</i>] No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You spoke of your friendship.
The time has come, prove that it
is genuine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Madame, why did I ever see
you? Why did I listen to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> What have you to regret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Nothing, Madame, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Explain yourself, Monsieur.
You&mdash;you make me afraid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>trying to calm her suspicions</i>].
Don't cry like that! There is no
reason why you should behave that way!
Your husband doesn't love you as he
ought, but he does love you. You are
jealous, that's what's troubling you. But
for that matter, why should he deceive
you? That would be too unjust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>excited</i>]. Too unjust!
You are right, Monsieur! No matter
how cynical, how blas&eacute; a man may be,
isn't it his duty, his sacred duty, to say
to himself, "I have found a good and
true woman in this world of deceptions;
she is a woman who adores me, who is
only too ready to invent any excuse for
me! She bears my name and honors it;
no matter what I do, she is always true,
of that I am positive. I am always foremost
in her thoughts, and I shall be her
only love." When a man can say all
that, Monsieur, isn't that real, true happiness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin</span> [<i>sobbing</i>]. Yes&mdash;that is happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You are crying! [<i>A
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> My wife&mdash;deceived me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Oh! [<i>A pause.</i>] Marcel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Your happiness is in no danger!
Yesterday I found some old letters,
in a desk&mdash;old letters&mdash;that was all!
You weren't his wife at the time. It's
ancient history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Who knows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Forgive me, Madame; your
troubles remind me of my own. When
you told of the happiness you still have
to give, I couldn't help thinking of what
I had lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> So you have come to fight
a duel with my husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Madame&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You are going to fight
him? Answer me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> My life is a wreck now&mdash;I
must&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I don't ask you to forget;
Monsieur&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> Don't you think I have a
right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> I shall not try to kill him.
You love him too much! I couldn't do
it now. In striking him I should be injuring
you, and you don't deserve to
suffer; you have betrayed no one. The
happiness you have just taught me to
know is as sacred and inviolable as my
honor, my unhappiness. I shall not seek
revenge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>gratefully</i>]. Oh, Monsieur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gu&eacute;rin.</span> I am willing he should live,
because he is so dear, so necessary to
you. Keep him. If he wants to spoil
your happiness, his be the blame! I
shall not do it. It would be sacrilege.
Good-by, Madame, good-by.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Gu&eacute;rin goes out, back, Fran&ccedil;oise
falls into a chair, sobbing.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Marcel by the little door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>aside, with a melancholy air</i>].
Refused to see me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>distinctly</i>]. Oh, it's you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>good-humoredly</i>]. Yes, it's I.
[<i>A pause. He goes toward her.</i>] You
have been crying! Have you seen
Gu&eacute;rin? He's been here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Marcel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Did he dare tell you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You won't see any more
of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. He's not going
to fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> He refuses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I took good care of your
dignity, you may be sure of that. Here
we were together; I told him the story
of my life during the last year&mdash;how I
loved you&mdash;and then he broke down.
When I learned the truth, he said he
would go away for my happiness' sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I was a coward to deceive
that man! Is this a final sentence that
you pass on me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Marcel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Both of you are big! You
have big hearts. I admire you both more
than I can say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>incredulously</i>]. Where are
you going? To get him to fight with
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>returning to her; angrily</i>].
How can I, now? After what you have
done, it would be absurd. Why the devil
did you have to mix yourself up in something
that doesn't concern you? I was
only looking for a chance to fight that
duel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Looking for a chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Oh, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>between his teeth</i>]. That's
my affair! Everybody has his enemies&mdash;his
insults to avenge. It was a very
good thing that gentleman didn't happen
across my path!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> How dare you recall what
he has been generous enough to forget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> How do you know that I
haven't a special reason for fighting this
duel? A legitimate reason, that must be
concealed from you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You are mistaken, dear: I
guess that reason perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>bursting forth</i>]. Oh! Good!
You haven't always been so frightfully
profound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Yes, I have, and your irony
only proves that I have not been so much
mistaken in what I felt by intuition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Ah, marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Ah, duty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I love Madame Gu&eacute;rin, don't
I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I don't say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You think it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> And if I do? Would it
be a crime to think it? You once loved
her&mdash;perhaps you have seen her again,
recently? Do I know where you go?
You never tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I tell you too much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I think you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You're jealous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Common, if you like.
Come, you must admit, Marcel, Madame
Gu&eacute;rin is in some way responsible for
your excitement now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Very well then, I love her, I
adore her! Are you satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You should have told me
that first, my dear; I should never have
tried to keep you away from her.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She breaks into tears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> She's crying! Good, there's
liberty for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. Liberty? I did
not suffer when I promised you your liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> That was your "resignation."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You knew life, I did not.
You ought never to have accepted it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You're like all the rest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>more excited</i>]. Doesn't unhappiness
level us all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I see it does!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> What can you ask for,
then? So long as you have no great happiness
like mine you are ready enough
to make any sacrifice, but when once you
have it, you never resign yourself to losing
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> That's just the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Be a little patient, dear:
I have not yet reached that state of cynicism
and subtlety which you seem to
want in your wife&mdash;I thought I came
near to your ideal once! Perhaps there's
some hope for me yet: I have promised
myself to do my best to satisfy your
ideal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>moved</i>]. I don't ask that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> You are right, I am very
foolish to try to struggle. What is the
good? It will suffice when I have lost
the dearest creature on earth&mdash;through
my foolishness, my blunders!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> The dearest creature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I can't help it if he seems
so to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>disarmed</i>]. You&mdash;you're trying
to appeal to my vanity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I am hardly in the mood
for joking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>tenderly, as he kneels at her
feet</i>]. But you make me say things like
that&mdash;I don't <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'now'">know</ins> what! I am not bad&mdash;really
bad! No, I have not deceived
you! I love you, and only you! You!
You know that, Fran&ccedil;oise! Ask&mdash;ask
any woman! All women!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>smiling through her tears</i>].
Best of husbands! You're not going out
then? You'll stay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>in Fran&ccedil;oise's arms</i>]. Can I
go now, now that I'm here? You are so
pretty that I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Not when I'm in trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Don't cry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I forgive you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Wait, I haven't confessed
everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Not another word!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I want to be sincere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> I prefer you to lie to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> First, read this note&mdash;the
one I received this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. From Madame
Gu&eacute;rin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> You saw her not long ago.
Yes, she calmly told me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> That her husband had
found some letters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> And that she was about to
leave for England with her lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then she is quite consoled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> Perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Poor Marcel! And you
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'want'">went</ins> to see her and try to prevent her
going away with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> My foolishness was well punished.
She wouldn't receive me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise.</span> Then I am the only one
left who loves you? How happy I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel.</span> I'll kill that love some day
with my ridiculous philandering!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. I defy you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>playfully</i>]. Then I no longer
have the right to provoke Monsieur
Gu&eacute;rin? Now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;oise</span> [<i>gayly</i>]. You are growing
old, Lovelace, his wife has deceived you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcel</span> [<i>lovingly</i>]. Fran&ccedil;oise' luck!
[<i>Sadly.</i>] Married!</p>

are doors at the right and in the center,
and at the left a window with heavy
porti&egrave;res. Behind a grand piano at the
right stands a Japanese screen which
conceals the fireplace. There are several
large trunks, open; bunches of flowers
are all over the room; many bouquets
are piled up on the piano.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet</span> [<i>entering from the adjoining

again? [<i>He opens the door and some
one hands him several large bunches of
flowers, which he places carefully on the
piano; then he goes back to his packing.
There is another knock. He opens the
door and takes a handful of letters. He
glances at the addresses and reads
aloud:</i> "Mister Gerardo. Monsieur
Gerardo. Gerardo Esquire. Signor
Gerardo." [<i>He drops the letters on a
tray and resumes his packing.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Gerardo.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Haven't you finished packing

you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> I'll be through in a minute,

Don't you know how to fold a pair of
trousers? [<i>Taking the trousers out.</i>]
This is what you call packing! Look
here! You still have something to learn
from me, after all. You take the trousers
like this.... You lock this up here....
Then you take hold of these buttons.
Watch these buttons here, that's the important
thing. Then&mdash;you pull them
straight.... There.... There.... Then
you fold them here.... See.... Now
these trousers would keep their shape for
a hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet</span> [<i>respectfully, with downcast
eyes</i>]. You must have been a tailor
once, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> What! Well, not exactly....
[<i>He gives the trousers to the Valet.</i>]
Pack those up, but be quick about it.
Now about that train. You are sure this
is the last one we can take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> It is the only one that gets
you there in time, sir. The next train
does not reach Brussels until ten o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Well, then, we must catch
this one. I will just have time to go
over the second act. Unless I go over
that.... Now don't let anybody.... I
am out to everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> All right, sir. There are some
letters for you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I have seen them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> And flowers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Yes. all right. [<i>He takes
the letters from the tray and throws
them on a chair before the piano. Then

with beaming eyes, crumples them up
and throws them under the chair.</i>] Remember!

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> I know, sir. [<i>He locks the
trunks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> To everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> You needn't worry, sir. [<i>Giving

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>pocketing the keys</i>]. To

again.</i>] <i>"Isolde! Geliebte! Bist du
mein? Hab' ich dich wieder?..."</i> [<i>He
clears his throat.</i>] The air is dead here.
[<i>He sings.</i>] <i>"Isolde! Geliebte...."</i> It's
oppressive here. Let's have a little fresh
air. [<i>He goes to the window at the left
and fumbles for the curtain cord.</i>]
Where is the thing? On the other side!
Here! [<i>He pulls the cord and throws
his head back with an annoyed expression

away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> What else can I do? God
knows, I haven't asked you to come here.
Do not take it badly, dear young lady,
but I have to sing to-morrow night in
Brussels. I must confess, I hoped I
would have this half-hour to myself. I
had just given positive orders not to let
any one, whoever it might be, come up to
my rooms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>coming down stage</i>].
Don't send me away. I heard you yesterday
in "Tannh&auml;user," and I was just
bringing you these roses, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> And&mdash;and what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> And myself.... I don't
know whether you understand me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>holding the back of a chair;
he hesitates, then shakes his head.</i>] Who
are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> My name is Miss
C&#339;urne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Yes.... Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> I am very silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I know. Come here, my
dear girl. [<i>He sits down in an armchair
and she stands before him.</i>] Let's have
a good earnest talk, such as you have
never had in your life&mdash;and seem to
need. An artist like myself&mdash;don't misunderstand
me; you are&mdash;how old are
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> Twenty-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> You are sixteen or perhaps
seventeen. You make yourself a
little older so as to appear more&mdash;tempting.
Well? Yes, you are very
silly. It is really none of my business,
as an artist, to cure you of your silliness....
Don't take this badly.... Now
then! Why are you staring away like
this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> I said I was very silly,
because I thought you Germans liked
that in a young girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I am not a German, but
just the same....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> What! I am not as
silly as all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Now look here, my dear girl&mdash;you
have your tennis court, your skating
club; you have your riding class,
your dances; you have all a young girl
can wish for. What on earth made you
come to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> Because all those
things are awful, and they bore me to
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I will not dispute that.
Personally, I must tell you, I know life
from an entirely different side. But, my
child, I am a man; I am thirty-six. The
time will come when you, too, will claim
a fuller existence. Wait another two
years and there will be some one for you,
and then you won't need to&mdash;hide yourself
behind curtains, in my room, in the
room of a man who&mdash;never asked you,
and whom you don't know any better
than&mdash;the whole continent of Europe
knows him&mdash;in order to look at life
from his&mdash;wonderful point of view.
[<i>Miss C&#339;urne sighs deeply.</i>] Now then ...
Many thanks from the bottom of
my heart for your roses. [<i>He presses
her hand.</i>] Will this do for to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> I had never in all my
life thought of a man, until I saw you
on the stage last night in "Tannh&auml;user."
And I promise you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Oh, don't promise me anything,
my child. What good could your
promise do me? The burden of it would
all fall upon you. You see, I am talking
to you as lovingly as the most loving
father could. Be thankful to God that
with your recklessness you haven't fallen
into the hands of another artist. [<i>He
presses her hand again.</i>] Let this be a
lesson to you and never try it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>holding her handkerchief
to her face but shedding no tears</i>].
Am I so homely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Homely! Not homely, but
young and indiscreet. [<i>He rises nervously,
goes to the right, comes back, puts
his arm around her waist and takes her
hand.</i>] Listen to me, child. You are
not homely because I have to be a singer,
because I have to be an artist. Don't
misunderstand me, but I can't see why
I should simply, because I am an artist,
have to assure you that I appreciate
your youthful freshness and beauty. It
is a question of time. Two hundred,
maybe three hundred, nice, lovely girls
of your age saw me last night in the r&ocirc;le
of Tannh&auml;user. Now if every one of
those girls made the same demands upon
me which you are making&mdash;what would
become of my singing? What would become
of my voice? What would become
of my art?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Miss C&#339;urne sinks into a seat, covers
her face and weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>leaning over the back of her
chair, in a friendly tone</i>]. It is a crime
for you, child, to weep over the fact that
you are still so young. Your whole life
is ahead of you. Is it my fault if you
fell in love with me? They all do.
That is what I am for. Now won't you
be a good girl and let me, for the few
minutes I have left, prepare myself for
to-morrow's appearance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>rising and drying her
tears</i>]. I can't believe that any other
girl would have acted the way I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>leading her to the door</i>].
No, dear child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>with sobs in her voice</i>].
At least, not if&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> If my valet had stood before
the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> If&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> If the girl had been as beautiful
and youthfully fresh as you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> If&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> If she had heard me only
once in "Tannh&auml;user."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>indignant</i>]. If she were
as respectable as I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>pointing to the piano</i>]. Before
saying good-by to me, child, have a
look at all those flowers. May this be a
warning to you in case you feel tempted
again to fall in love with a singer. See
how fresh they all are. And I have to
let them wither, dry up, or I give them
to the porter. And look at those letters.
[<i>He takes a handful of them from a
tray.</i>] I don't know any of those women.
Don't worry; I leave them all to their
fate. What else could I do? But I'll
wager with you that every one of your
lovely young friends sent in her little
note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> Well, I promise not
to do it again, not to hide myself behind
your curtains. But don't send me
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> My time, my time, dear
child. If I were not on the point of
taking a train! I have already told you,
I am very sorry for you. But my train
leaves in twenty-five minutes. What do
you expect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> A kiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>stiffening up</i>]. From me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>holding her around the waist
and looking very serious</i>]. You rob Art
of its dignity, my child. I do not wish
to appear an unfeeling brute, and I am
going to give you my picture. Give me
your word that after that you will leave
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Good. [<i>He sits at the table
and autographs one of his pictures.</i>]
You should try to become interested in
the operas themselves instead of the men
who sing them. You would probably derive
much greater enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne</span> [<i>to herself</i>]. I am too
young yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Sacrifice yourself to music.
[<i>He comes down stage and gives her the
picture.</i>] Don't see in me a famous
tenor but a mere tool in the hands of
a noble master. Look at all the married
women among your acquaintances. All
Wagnerians. Study Wagner's works;
learn to understand his <i>leit motifs</i>. That
will save you from further foolishness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss C&#339;urne.</span> I thank you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Gerardo leads her out and rings

<p><span class="smcap">Valet</span> [<i>coming in out of breath</i>]. Yes,

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> Not just now, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> There were three ladies who

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Don't you dare to let any

tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> And then here are some more
letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Oh, all right. [<i>The Valet
places the letters on a tray.</i>] And don't
you dare to let any one come up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet</span> [<i>at the door</i>]. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Even if she offers to settle a
fortune upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valet.</span> No, sir. [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> Maestro&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have&mdash;an
opera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> How did you get in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> I have been watching for
two hours for a chance to run up the

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> But, my dear good man, I
have no time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> Oh, I will not play the
whole opera for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I haven't the time. My train
leaves in forty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> You haven't the time!
What should I say? You are thirty and
successful. You have your whole life to
live yet. Just listen to your part in my
opera. You promised to listen to it
when you came to this city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> What is the use? I am not
a free agent&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> Please! Please! Please!
Maestro! I stand before you an old
man, ready to fall on my knees before
you; an old man who has never cared
for anything in the world but his art.
For fifty years I have been a willing
victim to the tyranny of art&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>interrupting him</i>]. Yes, I
understand; I understand, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. No, you don't
understand. You could not understand.
How could you, the favorite of fortune,
you understand what fifty years of bootless
work means? But I will try to make
you understand it. You see, I am too
old to take my own life. People who do
that do it at twenty-five, and I let the
time pass by. I must now drag along to
the end of my days. Please, sir, please
don't let these moments pass in vain for
me, even if you have to lose a day
thereby, a week even. This is in your
own interest. A week ago, when you
first came for your special appearances,
you promised to let me play my opera
for you. I have come here every day
since; either you had a rehearsal or a
woman caller. And now you are on the
point of going away. You have only to
say one word: I will sing the part of
Hermann&mdash;and they will produce my
opera. You will then thank God for my
insistance.... Of course you sing Siegfried,
you sing Florestan&mdash;but you have
no r&ocirc;le like Hermann in your repertoire,
no r&ocirc;le better suited to your middle register.</p>

closing the door, he turns to Duhring.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Oh, are you still there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring</span> [<i>undisturbed</i>]. This opera
is good; it is dramatic; it is a financial
success. I can show you letters from
Liszt, from Wagner, from Rubinstein,
in which they consider me as a superior
man. And why hasn't any opera ever
been produced? Because I am not crying
wares on the market-place. And then
you know our directors: they will revive
ten dead men before they give a live man
a chance. Their walls are well guarded.
At thirty you are in. At sixty I am still
out. One word from you and I shall be
in, too. This is why I have come, and
[<i>raising his voice</i>] if you are not an unfeeling
brute, if success has not killed in
you the last spark of artistic sympathy,
you will not refuse to hear my work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I will give you an answer
in a week. I will go over your opera.
Let me have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> No, I am too old, Maestro.
In a week, in what you call a week, I
shall be dead and buried. In a week&mdash;that
is what they all say; and then they
keep it for years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I am very sorry but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> To-morrow perhaps you
will be on your knees before me; you
will boast of knowing me ... and to-day,
in your sordid lust for gold, you
cannot even spare the half-hour which
would mean the breaking of my fetters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> No, really, I have only thirty-five
minutes left, and unless I go over
a few passages.... You know I sing
Tristan in Brussels to-morrow night.
[<i>He pulls out his watch.</i>] I haven't
even half an hour....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> Half an hour.... Oh,
then, let me play to you your big aria at
the end of the first act. [<i>He attempts
to sit down on the piano bench. Gerardo
restrains him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Now, frankly, my dear sir
... I am a singer; I am not a critic.
If you wish to have your opera produced,
address yourself to those gentlemen
who are paid to know what is good
and what is not. People scorn and ignore
my opinions in such matters as
completely as they appreciate and admire
my singing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> My dear Maestro, you may
take it from me that I myself attach no
importance whatever to your judgment.
What do I care about your opinions? I
know you tenors; I would like to play
my score for you so that you could say:
"I would like to sing the r&ocirc;le of Hermann."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> If you only knew how many
things I would like to do and which I
have to renounce, and how many things
I must do for which I do not care in the
least! Half a million a year does not
repay me for the many joys of life which
I must sacrifice for the sake of my profession.
I am not a free man. But you
were a free man all your life. Why
didn't you go to the market-place and
cry your wares?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> Oh, the vulgarity of it....
I have tried it a hundred times. I am a
composer, Maestro, and nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> By which you mean that you
have exhausted all your strength in the
writing of your operas and kept none
of it to secure their production.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> That is true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> The composers I know reverse
the process. They get their operas
written somehow and then spend all their
strength in an effort to get them produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> That is the type of artist I
despise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Well, I despise the type of
man that wastes his life in useless endeavor.
What have you done in those
fifty years of struggle, for yourself or
for the world? Fifty years of useless
struggle! That should convince the worst
blockhead of the impracticability of his
dreams. What have you done with your
life? You have wasted it shamefully.
If I had wasted my life as you have
wasted yours&mdash;of course I am only
speaking for myself&mdash;I don't think I
should have the courage to look any one
in the face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> I am not doing it for myself;
I am doing it for my art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. Art, my dear
man! Let me tell you that art is quite
different from what the papers tell us
it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span> To me it is the highest
thing in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> You may believe that, but
nobody else does. We artists are merely
a luxury for the use of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.
When I stand there on the stage I feel
absolutely certain that not one solitary
human being in the audience takes the
slightest interest in what we, the artists,
are doing. If they did, how could they
listen to "Die Walk&uuml;re," for instance?
Why, it is an indecent story which could
not be mentioned anywhere in polite society.
And yet, when I sing Siegmund,
the most puritanical mothers bring their
fourteen-year-old daughters to hear me.
This, you see, is the meaning of whatever
you call art. This is what you have sacrificed
fifty years of your life to. Find
out how many people came to hear me
sing and how many came to gape at me
as they would at the Emperor of China
if he should turn up here to-morrow.
Do you know what the artistic wants of
the public consist in? To applaud, to
send flowers, to have a subject for conversation,
to see and be seen. They pay
me half a million, but then I make business
for hundreds of cabbies, writers,
dressmakers, restaurant keepers. It
keeps money circulating; it keeps blood
running. It gets girls engaged, spinsters
married, wives tempted, old cronies supplied
with gossip; a woman loses her
pocketbook in the crowd, a fellow becomes
insane during the performance.
Doctors, lawyers made.... [<i>He coughs.</i>]
And with this I must sing Tristan in
Brussels to-morrow night! I tell you all
this, not out of vanity, but to cure you
of your delusions. The measure of a
man's worth is the world's opinion of
him, not the inner belief which one finally
adopts after brooding over it for years.
Don't imagine that you are a misunderstood
genius. There are no misunderstood
geniuses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring.</span>. Let me just play to you the
first scene of th second act. A park
landscape as in the painting, "Embarkation
for the Isle of Cythera."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I repeat to you I have no
time. And furthermore, since Wagner's
death the need for new operas has never
been felt by any one. If you come with
new music, you set against yourself all
the music schools, the artists, the public.
If you want to succeed just steal enough
out of Wagner's works to make up a
whole opera. Why should I cudgel my
brains with your new music when I
have cudgeled them cruelly with the
old?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring</span> [<i>holding out his trembling
hand</i>]. I am afraid I am too old to learn
how to steal. Unless one begins very
young, one can never learn it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Don't feel hurt. My dear
sir&mdash;if I could.... The thought of how
you have to struggle.... I happen to
have received some five hundred marks
more than my fee....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duhring</span> [<i>turning to the door</i>]. Don't!
Please don't! Do not say that. I did
not try to show you my opera in order
to work a touch. No, I think too much
of this child of my brain.... No, Maestro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes, kill myself. A day like
yesterday, without even seeing you&mdash;no,
I could not live through that again. I
am not strong enough. I beseech you,
Oscar, take me with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> You could if you wanted to.
You can't leave me without killing me.
These are not mere words. This isn't a
threat. It is a fact: I will die if I can
no longer have you. You must take me
with you&mdash;it is your duty&mdash;if only for
a short time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I give you my word of
honor, Helen, I can't&mdash;I give you my
word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> You must, Oscar. Whether
you can or not, you must bear the consequences
of your acts. I love life, but
to me life and you are one and the same
thing. Take me with you, Oscar, if you
don't want to have my blood on your
hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Do you remember what I
said to you the first day we were together
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I remember, but what good
does that do me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I said that there couldn't be
any question of love between us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I can't help that. I didn't
know you then. I never knew what a
man could be to me until I met you.
You know very well that it would come
to this, otherwise you wouldn't have
obliged me to promise not to make you
a parting scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I simply cannot take you
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Oh, God! I knew you would
say that! I knew it when I came here.
That's what you say to every woman.
And I am just one of a hundred. I
know it. But, Oscar, I am lovesick; I
am dying of love. This is your work,
and you can save me without any sacrifice
on your part, without assuming any
burden. Why can't you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>very slowly</i>]. Because my
contract forbids me to marry or to travel
in the company of a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>disturbed</i>]. What can prevent
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> My contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> You cannot....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I cannot marry until my
contract expires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> And you cannot....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I cannot travel in the company
of a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> That is incredible. And
whom in the world should it concern?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> My manager.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Your manager! What business
is it of his?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> It is precisely his business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Is it perhaps because it might&mdash;affect
your voice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> That is preposterous. Does
it affect your voice?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Gerardo chuckles.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Does your manager believe
that nonsense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> No, he doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> This is beyond me. I can't
understand how a decent man could sign
such a contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I am an artist first and a
man next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes, that's what you are&mdash;a
great artist&mdash;an eminent artist. Can't
you understand how much I must love
you? You are the first man whose superiority
I have felt and whom I desired
to please, and you despise me for it. I
have bitten my lips many a time not to
let you suspect how much you meant to
me; I was so afraid I might bore you.
Yesterday, however, put me in a state of
mind which no woman can endure. If I
didn't love you so insanely, Oscar, you
would think more of me. That is the
terrible thing about you&mdash;that you must
scorn a woman who thinks the world of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Your contract! Don't use
your contract as a weapon to murder me
with. Let me go with you, Oscar. You
will see if your manager ever mentions
a breach of contract. He would not do
such a thing. I know men. And if he
says a word, it will be time then for me
to die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> We have no right to do that,
Helen. You are just as little free to follow
me, as I am to shoulder such a responsibility.
I don't belong to myself; I
belong to my art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Oh, leave your art alone.
What do I care about your art? Has
God created a man like you to make a
puppet of himself every night? You
should be ashamed of it instead of boasting
of it. You see, I overlooked the fact
that you were merely an artist. What
wouldn't I overlook for a god like you?
Even if you were a convict, Oscar, my
feelings would be the same. I would lie
in the dust at your feet and beg for your
pity. I would face death as I am facing
it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Facing death,
Helen! Women who are endowed with
your gifts for enjoying life don't make
away with themselves. You know even
better than I do the value of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>dreamily</i>]. Oscar, I didn't
say that I would shoot myself. When
did I say that? Where would I find the
courage to do that? I only said that I
will die, if you don't take me with you.
I will die as I would of an illness, for I
only live when I am with you. I can live
without my home, without my children,
but not without you, Oscar. I cannot
live without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen, if you don't calm
yourself.... You put me in an awful
position.... I have only ten minutes
left.... I can't explain in court that
your excitement made me break my contract....
I can only give you ten minutes.... If
you don't calm yourself in
that time.... I can't leave you alone in
this condition. Think all you have at
stake!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> As though I had anything
else at stake!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> You can lose your position
in society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I can lose you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> And your family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I care for no one but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> But I cannot be yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Then I have nothing to lose
but my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Your children!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Who has taken me from them,
Oscar? Who has taken me from my children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Did I make any advances to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>passionately</i>]. No, no. I have
thrown myself at you, and would throw
myself at you again. Neither my husband
nor my children could keep me
back. When I die, at least I will have
lived; thanks to you, Oscar! I thank
you, Oscar, for revealing me to myself.
I thank you for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen, calm yourself and
listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes, yes, for ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Listen to me. [<i>Both sit
down on the divan.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>staring at him</i>]. Yes, I thank
you for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I don't even ask you to love
me. Let me only breathe the air you
breathe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span>[<i>trying to be calm</i>]. Helen&mdash;a
man of my type cannot be swayed
by any of the bourgeois ideas. I have
known society women in every country
of the world. Some made parting scenes
to me, but at least they all knew what
they owed to their position. This is the
first time in my life that I have witnessed
such an outburst of passion.... Helen,
the temptation comes to me daily to step
with some woman into an idyllic Arcadia.
But every human being has his duties;
you have your duties as I have mine,
and the call of duty is the highest thing
in the world....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I know better than you do
what the highest duty is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> What, then? Your love for
me? That's what they all say. Whatever
a woman has set her heart on winning
is to her good; whatever crosses her
plans is evil. It is the fault of our playwrights.
To draw full houses they set
the world upside down, and when a
woman abandons her children and her
family to follow her instincts they call
that&mdash;oh, broad-mindedness. I personally
wouldn't mind living the way turtle
doves live. But since I am a part of this
world I must obey my duty first. Then
whenever the opportunity arises I quaff
of the cup of joy. Whoever refuses to
do his duty has no right to make any demands
upon another fellow being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>staring absent-mindedly</i>]. That
does not bring the dead back to life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Helen, I will
give you back your life. I will give you
back what you have sacrificed for me.
For God's sake take it. What does it
come to, after all? Helen, how can a
woman lower herself to that point?
Where is your pride? What am I in the
eyes of the world? A man who makes a
puppet of himself every night! Helen,
are you going to kill yourself for a man
whom hundreds of women loved before
you, whom hundreds of women will love
after you without letting their feelings
disturb their life one second? Will you,
by shedding your warm red blood, make
yourself ridiculous before God and the
world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>looking away from him</i>]. I
know I am asking a good deal, but&mdash;what
else can I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen, you said I should
bear the consequences of my acts. Will
you reproach for not refusing to receive
you when you first came here, ostensibly
to ask me to try your voice? What can
a man do in such a case? You are the
beauty of this town. Either I would be
known as the bear among artists who
denies himself to all women callers, or I
might have received you and pretended
that I didn't understand what you meant
and then pass for a fool. Or the very
first day I might have talked to you as
frankly as I am talking now. Dangerous
business. You would have called me
a conceited idiot. Tell me, Helen&mdash;what
else could I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>staring at him with, imploring
eyes, shuddering and making an effort
to speak</i>]. O God! O God! Oscar,
what would you say if to-morrow I
should go and be as happy with another
man as I have been with you? Oscar&mdash;what
would you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>after a silence</i>]. Nothing.
[<i>He looks at his watch.</i>] Helen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Oscar! [<i>She kneels before
him.</i>] For the last time, I implore you....
You don't know what you are doing....
It isn't your fault&mdash;but don't let
me die.... Save me&mdash;save me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>raising her up</i>]. Helen, I
am not such a wonderful man. How
many men have you known? The more
men you come to know, the lower all men
will fall in your estimation. When you
know men better you will not take your
life for any one of them. You will not
think any more of them than I do of
women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> I am not like you in that respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> I speak earnestly, Helen.
We don't fall in love with one person or
another; we fall in love with our type,
which we find everywhere in the world
if we only look sharply enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> And when we meet our type,
are we sure then of being loved again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. You have no right
to complain of your husband. Was any
girl ever compelled to marry against her
will? That is all rot. It is only the
women who have sold themselves for certain
material advantages and then try to
dodge their obligations who try to make
us believe that nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. They break their
contracts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>pounding his chest</i>]. When
I sell myself, at least I am honest about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Isn't love honest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> No! Love is a beastly
bourgeois virtue. Love is the last refuge
of the mollycoddle, of the coward. In
my world every man has his actual value,
and when two human beings make up a
pact they know exactly what to expect
from each other. Love has nothing to
do with it, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Won't you lead me into your
world, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen, will you compromise
the happiness of your life and the happiness
of your dear ones for just a few
days' pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>much relieved</i>]. Will you
promise me to go home quietly now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> And will you promise me
that you will not die....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> You promise me that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> And you promise me to fulfill
your duties as mother and&mdash;as wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes. What else do you want?
I will promise anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> And now may I go away in
peace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> A last kiss?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> Yes, yes, yes. [<i>They kiss
passionately.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> In a year I am booked again
to sing here, Helen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span> In a year! Oh, I am glad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Helen!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Helen presses his hand, takes a revolver
out of her muff, shoots herself
and falls.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo.</span> Helen! [<i>He totters and collapses
in an armchair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bell Boy</span> [<i>rushing in</i>]. My God!
Mr. Gerardo! [<i>Gerardo remains motionless;
the Bell Boy rushes toward Helen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>jumping up, running to the
door and colliding with the manager of
the hotel</i>]. Send for the police! I must
be arrested! If I went away now I
should be a brute, and if I stay I break
my contract. I still have [<i>looking at his
watch</i>] one minute and ten seconds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Fred, run and get a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bell Boy.</span> All right, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Be quick about it. [<i>To
Gerardo.</i>] Don't take it too hard, sir.
Those things happen once in a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>kneeling before Helen's body
and taking her hand</i>]. Helen!... She
still lives&mdash;she still lives! If I am arrested
I am not wilfully breaking my
contract.... And my trunks? Is the
carriage at the door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> It has been waiting twenty
minutes, Mr. Gerardo. [<i>He opens the
door for the porter, who takes down one
of the trunks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>bending over her</i>]. Helen!
[<i>To himself.</i>] Well, after all.... [<i>To
Muller.</i>] Have you called a doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Yes, we had the doctor
called at once. He will be here at any
minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>holding her under the arms</i>].
Helen! Don't you know me any more? Helen! The doctor will be here right
away, Helen. This is your Oscar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bell Boy</span> [<i>appearing in the door at
the center</i>]. Can't find any policeman,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerardo</span> [<i>letting Helen's body drop
back</i>]. Well, if I can't get arrested, that
settles it. I must catch that train and
sing in Brussels to-morrow night. [<i>He
takes up his score and runs out through
the center door, bumping against several
chairs.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Rosamund's Flat; the drawing-room.
The apartment is plainly furnished.
There is a screen in the corner
of the room furthest from the door. It
is 9 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> Rosamund is seated alone at a
table. She wears a neat travelling-dress,
with a plain straw hat. Her gloves lie
on a chair. A small portable desk full
of papers is open before her. She gazes
straight in front of her, smiling vaguely.
With a start she recovers from her daydreams,
and rushing to the looking-glass,
inspects her features therein. Then she
looks at her watch.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Three hours yet! I'm a
fool [<i>with decision. She sits down again,
and idly picks up a paper out of the
desk. The door opens, unceremoniously
but quietly, and James enters. The two
stare at each other, James wearing a conciliatory
smile</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> You appalling creature!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I couldn't help it, I simply
couldn't help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Do you know this is the
very height and summit of indelicacy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I was obliged to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> If I had any relations&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Which you haven't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> I say <i>if</i> I had any relations&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I say <i>which</i> you haven't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Never mind, it is a safe
rule for unattached women always to behave
as if they had relations, especially
female relations whether they have any
or not. My remark is, that if I had any
relations they would be absolutely scandalized
by this atrocious conduct of
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> What have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Can you ask? Here are
you, and here am I. We are to be married
to-day at twelve o'clock. The ceremony
has not taken place, and yet you
are found on my premises. You must
surely be aware that on the day of the
wedding the parties&mdash;yes, the "parties,"
that is the word&mdash;should on no account
see each other till they see each other in
church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> But since we are to be married
at a registry office, does the rule
apply?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Then I must apologize. My
excuse is that I am not up in these
minute details of circumspection; you see
I have been married so seldom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Evidently. [<i>A pause, during
which James at last ventures to approach
the middle of the room.</i>] Now
you must go back home, and we'll pretend
we haven't seen each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Never, Rosamund! That would
be acting a lie. And I couldn't dream
of getting married with a lie on my lips.
It would be so unusual. No; we have
sinned, or rather I have sinned, on this
occasion. I will continue to sin&mdash;openly,
brazenly. Come here, my dove. A bird
in the hand is worth two under a bushel.
[<i>He assumes an attitude of entreaty, and,
leaving her chair, Rosamund goes towards
him. They exchange an ardent kiss.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>quietly submissive</i>]. I'm
awfully busy, you know, Jim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I will assist you in your little
duties, dearest, and then I will accompany
you to the sacred ed&mdash;to the registry
office. Now, what were you doing?
[<i>She sits down, and he puts a chair for
himself close beside her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> You are singularly unlike
yourself this morning, dearest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Nervous tension, my angel. I
should have deemed it impossible that an
<i>employ&eacute;</i> of the War Office could experience
the marvelous and exquisite sensations
now agitating my heart. But
tell me, what are you doing with these
papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Well, I was just going to
look through them and see if they contained
anything of a remarkable or valuable
nature. You see, I hadn't anything
to occupy myself with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Was 'oo bored, waiting for
the timey-pimey to come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>hands caressing</i>]. 'Iss,
little pet was bored, she was. Was Mr.
Pet lonely this morning? Couldn't he
keep away from his little cooky-lecturer?
He should see his little cooky-lecturer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> And that reminds me, hadn't
we better lunch in the train instead of
at Willis's? That will give us more time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Horrid greedy piggywiggy!
Perhaps he will be satisfied if
Mrs. Pet agrees to lunch both at Willis's
and in the train?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Yes. Only piggywiggy doesn't
want to trespass on Mrs. Pet's good
nature. Let piggywiggy look at the papers.
[<i>He takes up a paper from the
desk.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>a little seriously</i>]. No,
Jimmy. I don't think we'll go through
them. Perhaps it wouldn't be wise.
Just let's destroy them. [<i>Takes papers
from his hand and drops them in desk.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. When you have been
the wife of a War Office clerk for a week
you will know that papers ought never
to be destroyed. Now I come to think,
it is not only my right but my duty to
examine this secret <i>dossier</i>. Who knows&mdash;[<i>Takes
up at random another document,
which proves to be a postcard.
Reads.</i>] "Shall come to-morrow night.
Thine, Gerald."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>after a startled shriek of
consternation</i>]. There! There! You've
done it, first time! [<i>She begins to think,
with knitted brows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Does this highly suspicious
postcard point to some&mdash;some episode
in your past of which you have deemed
it advisable to keep me in ignorance? If
so, I seek not to inquire. I forgive you&mdash;I
take you, Rosamund, as you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>reflective, not heeding his
remark</i>]. I had absolutely forgotten the
whole affair, absolutely. [<i>Smiles a little.
Aside.</i>] Suppose he should come! [<i>To
James.</i>] Jim, I think I had better tell
you all about Gerald. It will interest
you. Besides, there is no knowing what
may happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> As I have said, I seek not to
inquire. [<i>Stiffly.</i>] Nor do I imagine
that this matter, probably some childish
entanglement, would interest me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Oh, wouldn't it! Jim,
don't be absurd. You know perfectly
well you are dying to hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Very well, save my life, then,
at the least expense of words. To begin
with, who is this Gerald&mdash;"thine," thine
own Gerald?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Don't you remember Gerald
O'Mara? You met him at the
Stokes's, I feel sure. You know&mdash;the
young engineer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Oh! <i>That</i> ass!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> He isn't an ass. He's a
very clever boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> For the sake of argument and
dispatch, agreed! Went out to Cyprus
or somewhere, didn't he, to build a bridge,
or make a dock, or dig a well, or something
of that kind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>nodding</i>]. Now, listen,
I'll tell you all about it. [<i>Settles herself
for a long narration.</i>] Four years ago
poor, dear Gerald was madly in love with
me. He was twenty and I was twenty-four.
Keep calm&mdash;I felt like his aunt.
Don't forget I was awfully pretty in
those days. Well, he was so tremendously
in love that in order to keep him
from destroying himself&mdash;of course, I
knew he was going out to Cyprus&mdash;I
sort of pretended to be sympathetic. I
simply <i>had</i> to; Irishmen are so passionate.
And he was very nice. And I
barely knew you then. Well, the time
approached for him to leave for Cyprus,
and two days before the ship sailed he
sent me that very postcard that by pure
chance you picked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> He should have written a letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Oh! I expect he couldn't
wait. He was so impulsive. Well, on
the night before he left England he came
here and proposed to me. I remember
I was awfully tired and queer. I had
been giving a lecture in the afternoon on
"How to Pickle Pork," and the practical
demonstration had been rather smelly.
However, the proposal braced me up. It
was the first I had had&mdash;that year.
Well, I was so sorry for him that I
couldn't say "No" outright. It would
have been too brutal. He might have
killed himself on the spot, and spoilt this
carpet, which, by the way, was new then.
So I said, "Look here, Gerald&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> You called him "Gerald"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> <i>Rather!</i> "Look here, Gerald,"
I said; "you are going to Cyprus
for four years. If your feeling towards
me is what you think it is, come back
to me at the end of those four years,
and I will then give you an answer." Of
course I felt absolutely sure that in the
intervening period he would fall in and
out of love half a dozen times at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Of course, half a dozen times
at least; probably seven. What did he
say in reply?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> He agreed with all the
seriousness in the world. "On this day
four years hence," he said, standing just
there [<i>pointing</i>], "I will return for your
answer. And in the meantime I will live
only for you." That was what he said&mdash;his
very words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> And a most touching speech,
too! And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> We shook hands, and he
tore himself away, stifling a sob. Don't
forget, he was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Have the four years expired?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> What is the date of that
postcard? Let me see it. [<i>Snatches it,
and smiles at the handwriting pensively.</i>]
July 4th&mdash;four years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Then it's over. He's not coming.
To-day is July 5th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> But yesterday was Sunday.
He wouldn't come on Sunday. He
was always very particular and nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Do you mean to imply that
you think he will come to-day and demand
from you an affirmative? A moment
ago you gave me to understand that
in your opinion he would have&mdash;er&mdash;other
affairs to attend to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Yes. I did think so at
the time. But now&mdash;now I have a kind
of idea that he may come, that after all
he may have remained faithful. You
know I was maddeningly pretty then,
and he had my photograph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Tell me, have you corresponded?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> No, I expressly forbade
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> But still, I have a premonition
he may come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>assuming a pugnacious pose</i>].
If he does, I will attend to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Gerald was a terrible
fighter. [<i>A resounding knock is heard
at the door. Both start violently, and
look at each other in silence. Rosamund
goes to the door and opens it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>with an unsteady laugh of
relief</i>]. Only the postman with a letter.
[<i>She returns to her seat.</i>] No, I don't
expect he will come, really. [<i>Puts letter
idly on table. Another knock still louder.
Renewed start.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Now that <i>is</i> he, I'm positive.
He always knocked like that. Just
fancy. After four years! Jim, just take
the chair behind that screen for a bit. I
<i>must</i> hide you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> No, thanks! The screen dodge
is a trifle <i>too</i> frayed at the edges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Only for a minute. It
would be <i>such</i> fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> No, thanks. [<i>Another knock.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>with forced sweetness</i>].
Oh, very well, then....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Oh, well, of course, if you
take it in that way&mdash;[<i>He proceeds to a
chair behind screen, which does not, however,
hide him from the audience.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>smiles his reward</i>]. I'll
explain it all right. [<i>Loudly.</i>] Come
in! [<i>Enter Gerald O'Mara.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> So you are in! [<i>Hastens
across room to shake hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Oh, yes, I am in. Gerald,
how are you? I must say you look tolerably
well. [<i>They sit down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oh, I'm pretty fit, thanks.
Had the most amazing time in spite of
the climate. And you? Rosie, you
haven't changed a little bit. How's the
cookery trade getting along? Are you
still showing people how to concoct
French dinners out of old bones and a
sardine tin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Certainly. Only I can do
it without the bones now. You see, the
science has progressed while you've been
stagnating in Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Stagnating is the word. You
wouldn't believe that climate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> What! Not had nice
weather? What a shame! I thought it
was tremendously sunshiny in Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Yes, that's just what it is, 97&deg;
in the shade when it doesn't happen to
be pouring with malarial rain. We
started a little golf club at Nicosia, and
laid out a nine-hole course. But the balls
used to melt. So we had to alter the
rules, keep the balls in an ice-box, and
take a fresh one at every hole. Think
of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> My poor boy! But I suppose
there were compensations? You referred
to "an amazing time."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Yes, there were compensations.
And that reminds me, I want you
to come out and lunch with me at the
Savoy. I've got something awfully important
to ask you. In fact, that's what
I've come for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Sorry I can't, Gerald.
The fact is, I've got something awfully
important myself just about lunch
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oh, yours can wait. Look
here, I've ordered the lunch. I made
sure you'd come. [<i>Rosamund shakes her
head.</i>] Why can't you? It's not cooking,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Only a goose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> What goose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Well&mdash;my own, and somebody
else's. Listen, Gerald. Had you
not better ask me this awfully important
question now? No time like the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> I can always talk easier, especially
on delicate topics, with a pint of
something handy. But if you positively
won't come, I'll get it off my chest now.
The fact is, Rosie, I'm in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> With whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Ah! That's just what I want
you to tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>suddenly starting</i>]. Gerald!
what is that dreadful thing sticking
out of your pocket, and pointing right at
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> That? That's my revolver.
Always carry them in Cyprus, you know.
Plenty of sport there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>breathing again</i>]. Kindly
take it out of your pocket and put it on
the table. Then if it does go off it
will go off into something less valuable
than a cookery-lecturer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> [<i>laughingly obeying her</i>].
There. If anything happens it will happen
to the screen. Now, Rosie, I'm in
love, and I desire that you should tell
me whom I'm in love with. There's a
magnificent girl in Cyprus, daughter of
the Superintendent of Police&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Evelyn. Age nineteen. I
tell you I was absolutely gone on her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Symptoms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Well&mdash;er&mdash;whenever her
name was mentioned I blushed terrifically.
Of course, that was only one symptom....
Then I met a girl on the home
steamer&mdash;no father or mother. An orphan,
you know, awfully interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Madge. Nice name, isn't it?
[<i>Rosamund nods.</i>] I don't mind telling
you, I was considerably struck by her&mdash;still
am, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Symptoms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oh!... Let me see, I never
think of her without turning absolutely
pale. I suppose it's what they call "pale
with passion." Notice it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>somewhat coldly</i>]. It
seems to me the situation amounts to
this. There are two girls. One is named
Evelyn, and the thought of her makes
you blush. The other is named Madge,
and the thought of her makes you turn
pale. You fancy yourself in love, and
you wish me to decide for you whether it
is Madge or Evelyn who agitates your
breast the more deeply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> That's not exactly the way to
put it, Rosie. You take a fellow up too
soon. Of course I must tell you lots
more yet. You should hear Evelyn play
the "Moonlight Sonata." It's the most
marvelous thing.... And then Madge's
eyes! The way that girl can look at a
fellow.... I'm telling you all these
things, you know, Rosie, because I've always
looked up to you as an elder sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>after a pause, during
which she gazes into his face</i>]. I suppose
it was in my character of your elder sister,
that you put a certain question to
me four years ago last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> [<i>staggered; pulls himself together
for a great resolve; after a long
pause</i>]. Rosie! I never thought afterwards
you'd take it seriously. I forgot
it all. I was only a boy then. [<i>Speaking
quicker and quicker.</i>] But I see
clearly now. I never <i>could</i> withstand
you. It's all rot about Evelyn and
Madge. It's you I'm in love with; and
I never guessed it! Rosie!... [<i>Rushes
to her and impetuously flings his arms
around her neck.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>who, during the foregoing
scene, has been full of uneasy gestures;
leaping with incredible swiftness from
the shelter of the screen</i>]. Sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>pushing Gerald quickly
away</i>]. Gerald!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> May I inquire, sir, what is the
precise significance of this attitudinising?
[<i>Gerald has scarcely yet abandoned
his amorous pose, but now does so
quickly</i>]. Are we in the middle of a
scene from "Romeo and Juliet," or is
this 9:30 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> in the nineteenth century?
If Miss Fife had played the "Moonlight
Sonata" to you, or looked at you as
Madge does, there might perhaps have
been some shadow of an excuse for your
extraordinary and infamous conduct.
But since she has performed neither of
these feats of skill, I fail to grasp&mdash;I
say I fail to grasp&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> [<i>slowly recovering from an
amazement which has rendered him
mute</i>]. Rosie, a man concealed in your
apartment! But perhaps it is the piano-tuner.
I am willing to believe the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Let me introduce Mr.
James Brett, my future husband. Jim,
this is Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I have gathered as much.
[<i>The men bow stiffly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>dreamily</i>]. Poor, poor
Gerald! [<i>Her tone is full of feeling.
James is evidently deeply affected by it.
He walks calmly and steadily to the table
and picks up the revolver.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Sir, that tool is mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Sir, the fact remains that it is
an engine of destruction, and that I intend
to use it. Rosamund, the tone in
which you uttered those three words,
"Poor, poor Gerald!" convinces me, a
keen observer of symptoms, that I no
longer possess your love. Without your
love, life to me is meaningless. I object
to anything meaningless&mdash;even a word.
I shall therefore venture to deprive myself
of life. Good-by! [<i>To Gerald.</i>]
Sir, I may see you later. [<i>Raises the
revolver to his temples.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>appealing to Gerald to interfere</i>].
Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Mr. Brett, I repeat that that
revolver is mine. It would be a serious
breach of good manners if you used it
without my consent, a social solecism of
which I believe you, as a friend of Miss
Fife's, to be absolutely incapable. Still,
as the instrument happens to be in your
hand, you may use it&mdash;but not on yourself.
Have the goodness, sir, to aim at
me. I could not permit myself to stand
in the way of another's happiness, as I
should do if I continued to exist. At the
same time I have conscientious objections
to suicide. You will therefore do
me a service by aiming straight. Above
all things, don't hit Miss Fife. I merely
mention it because I perceive that you
are unaccustomed to the use of firearms.
[<i>Folds his arms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Rosamund, <i>do</i> you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> My Jim!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>deeply moved</i>]. The possessive
pronoun convinces me that you do.
[<i>Smiling blandly.</i>] Sir, I will grant your
most reasonable demand. [<i>Aims at Gerald.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>half shrieking</i>]. I don't
love you if you shoot Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> But, my dear, this is irrational.
He has asked me to shoot him,
and I have as good as promised to do
so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>entreating</i>]. James, in two
hours we are to be married.... Think
of the complications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Married! To-day! Then I
withdraw my request.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Yes; perhaps it will be as well.
[<i>Lowers revolver.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> I have never yet knowingly
asked a friend, even an acquaintance, to
shoot me on his wedding-day, and I will
not begin now. Moreover, now I come
to think of it, the revolver wasn't loaded.
Mr. Brett, I inadvertently put you in a
ridiculous position. I apologize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I accept the apology. [<i>The
general tension slackens. Both the men
begin to whistle gently, in the effort after
unconcern.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Jim, will you oblige me
by putting that revolver down somewhere.
I know it isn't loaded; but so
many people have been killed by guns
that weren't loaded that I should feel
safer.... [<i>He puts it down on the
table.</i>] Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>picking up letter</i>]. By the
way, here's that letter that came just
now. Aren't you going to open it? The
writing seems to me to be something like
Lottie Dickinson's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>taking the letter</i>]. It isn't
Lottie's; it's her sister's. [<i>Stares at envelope.</i>]
I know what it is. I <i>know</i>
what it is. Lottie is ill, or dead, or
something, and can't come and be a witness
at the wedding. I'm sure it's that.
Now, if she's dead we can't <i>be</i> married
to-day; it wouldn't be decent. And it's
frightfully unlucky to have a wedding
postponed. Oh, but there isn't a black
border on the envelope, so she can't be
<i>dead</i>. And yet perhaps it was so sudden
they hadn't time to buy mourning stationery!
This is the result of your coming
here this morning. I felt sure something
would happen. Didn't I tell you
so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> No, you didn't, my dear. But
why don't you open the letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> I am opening it as fast as
I can. [<i>Reads it hurriedly.</i>] There!
I said so! Lottie fell off her bicycle last
night, and broke her ankle&mdash;won't be
able to stir for a fortnight&mdash;in great
pain&mdash;hopes it won't <i>inconvenience</i> us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Inconvenience! I must say I
regard it as very thoughtless of Lottie
to go bicycling the very night before our
wedding. Where did she fall off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Sloane Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> That makes it positively criminal.
She always falls off in Sloane
Street. She makes a regular practice of
it. I have noticed it before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Perhaps she did it on
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Not a doubt of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> She doesn't want us to
get married!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I have sometimes suspected
that she had a certain tenderness for me.
[<i>Endeavoring to look meek.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> The cat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> By no means. Cats are never
sympathetic. She is. Let us be just before
we are jealous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Jealous! My dear James!
Have you noticed how her skirts hang?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Hang her skirts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> You wish to defend
her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> On the contrary; it was I who
first accused her. [<i>Gerald, to avoid the
approaching storm, seeks the shelter of
the screen, sits down, and taking some
paper from his pocket begins thoughtfully
to write.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> My dear James, let me
advise you to keep quite, quite calm.
You are a little bit upset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I am a perfect cucumber.
But I can hear you breathing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> If you are a cucumber,
you are a very indelicate cucumber.
I'm not breathing more than is necessary
to sustain life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Yes, you are; and what's more
you'll cry in a minute if you don't take
care. You're getting worked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> No, I shan't. [<i>Sits down
and cries.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> What did I tell you? Now
perhaps you will inform me what we are
quarreling about, because I haven't the
least idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>through her sobs</i>]. I do
think it's <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'horried'">horrid</ins> of Lottie. We can't
be married with one witness. And I
didn't want to be married at a registry
office at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> My pet, we can easily get another
witness. As for the registry office,
it was yourself who proposed it, as
a way out of a difficulty. I'm High and
you're Low&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> I'm not Low; I'm Broad,
or else Evangelical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> [<i>beginning calmly again</i>]. I'm
High and you're Broad, and there was a
serious question about candles and a
genuflexion, and so we decided on the
registry office, which, after all, is much
cheaper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>drying her tears, and putting
on a saintly expression</i>]. Well, anyhow,
James, we will consider our engagement
at an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> This extraordinary tiff has
lasted long enough, Rosie. Come and be
kissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>with increased saintliness</i>].
You mistake me, James. I am not quarreling.
I am not angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Then you have ceased to love
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> I adore you passionately.
But we can never marry. Do you not
perceive the warnings against such a
course? First of all you come here&mdash;drawn
by some mysterious, sinister impulse&mdash;in
breach of all etiquette. That
was a Sign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> A sign of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Evil. Then you find that
postcard, to remind me of a forgotten
episode.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Damn the postcard! I wish
I'd never picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Hush! Then comes this
letter about Lottie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Damn that, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>sighs</i>]. Then Gerald arrives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Damn him, too! By the way,
where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald</span> [<i>coming out from behind the
screen</i>]. Sir, if you want to influence
my future state by means of a blasphemous
expletive, let me beg you to do
it when ladies are not present. There
are certain prayers which should only
be uttered in the smoking-room. [<i>The
two men stab each other with their eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> I respectfully maintain, Mr.
O'Mara, that you had no business to
call on my future wife within three
hours of her wedding, and throw her
into such a condition of alarm and unrest
that she doesn't know whether she is going
to get married or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Sir! How in the name of
Heaven was I to guess&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>rising, with an imperative
gesture</i>]. Stop! Sit down, both. James
[<i>who hesitates</i>], this is the last request
I shall ever make of you. [<i>He sits</i>].
Let me speak. Long ago, from a mistaken
motive of kindness, I gave this
poor boy [<i>pointing to Gerald</i>] to understand
that I loved him; that any rate
I should love him in time. Supported
by that assurance, he existed for four
years through the climatic terrors of a
distant isle. I, pampered with all the
superfluities of civilization, forgot this
noble youth in his exile. I fell selfishly
in love. I promised to marry ... while
he, with nothing to assuage the rigors&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Pardon me, there was Evelyn's
"Moonlight Sonata," not to mention
Madge's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> You jest, James, but the
jest is untimely. Has he not himself
said that these doubtless excellent young
women were in fact nothing to him, that
it was <i>my</i> image which he kept steadfastly
in his heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Ye&mdash;es, of course, Rosie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>chiefly to James</i>]. The
sight of this poor youth fills me with
sorrow and compunction and shame.
For it reminds me that four years ago
I lied to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> It was awfully good of you,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> That is beside the point.
At an earlier period of this unhappy
morning, James, you asseverated that
you could not dream of getting married
with a lie on your lips. Neither can I.
James, I love you to madness. [<i>Takes
his inert hand, shakes it, and drops it
again.</i>] Good-by, James! Henceforth
we shall be strangers. My duty is towards
Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> But if you love <i>him</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> With a good woman, conscience
comes first, love second. In time
I shall learn to love <i>you</i>. I was always
quick at lessons. Gerald, take me. It
is the only way by which I can purge
my lips of the lie uttered four years ago.
[<i>Puts her hands on Gerald's shoulders.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> In about three-quarters of an
hour you will regret this, Rosamund Fife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> One never regrets a good
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oh! well! I say.... [<i>inarticulate
with embarrassment</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. James, we
are waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> For you to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Don't mind me. You forget
that I am in the War Office, and accustomed
to surprising situations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Look here, Rosie. It's awfully
good of you, and you're doing me a
frightfully kind turn; but I can't accept
it, you know. It wouldn't do. Kindness
spoils my character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Yes, and think of the shock
to the noble youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> I couldn't permit such a
sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> To a good woman life
should be one long sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Yes, that's all very well, and
I tell you, Rosie, I'm awfully obliged to
you. Of course I'm desperately in love
with you. That goes without saying.
But I also must sacrifice myself. The
fact is ... there's Madge....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Well, you know what a place
a steamer is, especially in calm, warm
weather. I'm afraid I've rather led her
to expect.... The fact is, while you and
Mr. Brett were having your little discussion
just now, I employed the time in
scribbling out a bit of a letter to her,
and I rather fancy that I've struck one
or two deuced good ideas in the proposal
line. How's this for a novelty:
"My dear Miss Madge, you cannot fail
to have noticed from my behavior in
your presence that I admire you tremendously?"
Rather a neat beginning,
eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> But you said you loved
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Oh, well, so I do. You see
I only state that I "admire" her. All
the same I feel I'm sort of bound to her, ...
you see how I'm fixed. I should
much prefer, of course....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> To a good man life should be
one long sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Exactly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>steadying herself and approaching
James</i>]. Jim, my sacrifice is
over. It was a terrible ordeal, and nothing
but a strict sense of duty could have
supported me through such a trying
crisis. I am yours. Lead me to the altar.
I trust Gerald may be happy with
this person named Madge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> The flame of your love has
not faltered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Ah, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Well, if my own particular
flame hadn't been fairly robust, the recent
draughts might have knocked it
about a bit. You have no more sacrifices
in immediate view?... [<i>She looks at
him in a certain marvelous way, and he
suddenly swoops down and kisses her.</i>]
To the altar! March! Dash; we shall
want another witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Couldn't I serve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> You're sure it wouldn't
be too much for your feelings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> I should enjoy it.... I
mean I shan't mind very much. Let us
therefore start. If we're too soon you
can watch the process at work on others,
and learn how to comport yourselves.
By the way, honeymoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> Paris. Charing Cross 1:30.
Dine at Dover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Then you shall eat that
lunch I have ordered at the Savoy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> Er&mdash;talking of lunch, as
I'm hostess here, perhaps I should ask
you men if you'd like a drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James and Gerald</span> [<i>looking hopefully
at each other</i>]. Well, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> I have some beautiful
lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James</span> AND <span class="smcap">Gerald</span> [<i>still looking at
each other, but with a different expression</i>].
Oh, that will be delightful!
[<i>Lemonade and glasses produced.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> I drink to the happy pair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund</span> [<i>a little sinister</i>]. And I&mdash;to
Madge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> And I&mdash;to a good woman&mdash;Mrs.
Pet [<i>looking at her fixedly</i>]. All
men like a good woman, but she
shouldn't be too good&mdash;it's a strain on
the system. [<i>General consumption of
lemonade, the men bravely swallowing it
down, Rosamund rests her head on
James's shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosamund.</span> It occurs to me, Gerald,
you only ordered lunch for two at the
Savoy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span> Well, that's right. By that
time you and James, if I may call him
so, will be one, and me makes two.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE STONE HOUSE</h2>

<p class="alignleft">A Play</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Prask&oacute;vya's sitting-room. Street
door in porch and a curtainless window
at the back. It is night; the light of an
oil-lamp in the street dimly shows snow-covered
houses and falling snow. The
room is plainly furnished: a bed, a curtain
on a cord, some books, eikons on a
shelf in the corner with a wick in a red
glass bowl burning before them, paper
flowers, and Easter eggs on strings. A
photograph of a man of twenty hangs
by the eikons. There are doors to
kitchen and to the lodgers' rooms.</i></p>

<p><i>Varv&aacute;ra is discovered sitting by a
lamp darning stockings.</i></p>

<p><i>There is an atmosphere of silence,
solitude, and Russian monotony. The
clock ticks. A man is seen passing in
the street; his feet make no sound on the
snowy ground. There is the sound of a
concertina and a man who laughs in the
distance out of doors. Then silence
again.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter Ast&eacute;ryi, stout and lazy; gray
hair thrown untidily back, a rough beard.
He is in slippers and dirty dressing-gown,
with a big case full of Russian
cigarettes in his pocket.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Is Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna not at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> [<i>rising</i>]. She is not at home,
Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch. She has gone to
Vespers at St. Pantal&eacute;imon's in the
Marsh. It is the festival of the translation
of St. Pantal&eacute;imon's relics. [<i>Varv&aacute;ra
sits again. Ast&eacute;ryi walks to and
fro smoking a cigarette.</i>] Will you not
have your game of patience as usual?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Without Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> She would be sorry if you
missed your game because she was late.
You can play again when she returns;
she likes to watch you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Very well.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Varv&aacute;ra gets a pack of cards. Ast&eacute;ryi
sits at a table at one side
and plays.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> Shall I prepare the samovar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Not yet; I will wait. How
greasy these cards are [<i>laying out a patience</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> No wonder, Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch.
It is two years since you bought this
pack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Voice</span> [<i>without</i>]. Varv&aacute;ra! Varv&aacute;ra!
There is no water in my jug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> There is one of the lodgers calling
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> It is the schoolmaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Better not keep him waiting; he
is an angry man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> I will go. Excuse me, please.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit Varv&aacute;ra. The clock ticks
again. Ast&eacute;ryi pauses and meditates,
then murmurs, "Oh, H&oacute;spodi!"
as if in surprise at being
so terribly bored. The concertina
plays a few notes. A knock at
the street door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Who's there? Come in, come in!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Spirid&oacute;n, a man with a cringing,
crafty manner, in a sheepskin
coat with snow on it. He stands by
the door, facing the eikon, crossing
himself with large gestures and
bowing very low towards it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> [<i>looking round</i>]. Good-day, sir,
good-day.  [<i>Crossing himself again.</i>]
May the holy saints preserve all in this
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Ah! it's you, Spirid&oacute;n?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> Yes, sir. It is Spirid&oacute;n the
stonemason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> What brings you here, Spirid&oacute;n?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> Is Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna not at
home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> No, she has gone to Vespers at
St. Pantal&eacute;imon's in the Marsh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> The service is late to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Yes.... You are a hard man,
Spirid&oacute;n.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> Me, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> And you lose money by your
hardness. Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna is a
poor woman. For years she has been
saving up money to build a stone house
over the grave of her son in the Tr&oacute;itski
Cemetery. You say that you will build
it for 500 roubles, but you ask too much.
By starving herself and pinching in every
way she has saved up 400 roubles at last,
and if you were a wise man you would
accept it. For see, she is old; if she
starve herself to save up another 100
roubles she will be dead before she has
got it; her money will be sent back to her
village or it will go into the pocket of
some official, and you will not have the
tomb-house to build at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> I have thought of all these
things, Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch, since you last
spoke to me about it. And I said to myself:
Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch is perhaps
right; it is not only Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna
who is old; I myself am old also, and
may die before she has saved up money
enough. But it is very hard to work and
be underpaid. Good Valdai stone is expensive
and hard to cut, and workmen
nowadays ask for unholy wages. Still,
I said to myself, a tomb-house for her
son&mdash;it is a God-fearing work: and I
have resolved to make the sacrifice. I
have come to tell her I will consent to
build it for 400 roubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> You have done rightly. You are
an honest man, and God and St. Nicholas
will perhaps save your soul.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Fom&aacute; in cap and great-coat
from the door to the lodgers'
rooms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Good-evening, Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch.
Is Prask&oacute;vya not at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> No, she is at Vespers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> I come in and find my stove
smoking. [<i>Taking of his coat.</i>] I
wished to ask her permission to sit here
awhile to escape a headache. Who is
this? Ah, Spirid&oacute;n. And by what miracle
does Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch hope that
God and St. Nicholas will save your
soul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He has consented to build Prask&oacute;vya
Petr&oacute;vna the tomb-house over
Sasha's grave for 400 roubles instead of
500.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> That is good! She will be
glad to hear the news, and shake hands
on the bargain, and christen the earnest-money
with vodka.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> The earnest-money? Ah no, sir,
there can be no earnest-money. The
whole sum of money must be paid at
once. I am a poor man. I must pay
the quarryman for the stone; my workmen
cannot live on air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> If she has the money she will
pay you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Well, if there is to be no
earnest-money, at least we will have the
vodka. Vodka is always good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> [<i>to Spirid&oacute;n</i>]. Sit down and wait
till she returns. She will not be long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> No, no; I will come again in an
hour. I have to go to my brother-in-law
two streets away. [<i>Crossing himself before
the eikons.</i>] I will come again as I
return.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The tap of drums in the street.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Why are they beating drums?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It is a patrol passing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> The soldiers are very watchful
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It is because the Empress
comes this way to-morrow on her journey
to Smolensk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> They have arrested many suspicious
people. All those who have no
passports are being sent away to Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Ah! poor creatures! [<i>A patrol
of soldiers passes the window quietly</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> Why should you say "poor
creatures"? If they were honest men
they would not be without passports.
Good-evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Wait till they have gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spir.</span> We honest men have nothing to
fear from them. Good-evening. I will
return again in an hour. [<i>Exit Spirid&oacute;n.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> How glad Prask&oacute;vya will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Say nothing of this to any one.
We will keep it as a surprise.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Varv&aacute;ra.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;</span>. Varv&aacute;ra, my pretty child,
fetch the bottle of vodka from my room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var</span>. Vodka in here? Prask&oacute;vya
Petr&oacute;vna will be angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;</span>. No, she will not be angry; she
will be glad. [<i>Exit Varv&aacute;ra.</i>] Do you
play patience here every night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast</span>. Every night for more than
twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> What is it called?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It is called the Wolf!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Does it ever come out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It has come out twice. The first
time I found a purse in the street which
somebody had lost. The second time the
man above me at the office died, and I
got his place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It brings good luck then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> To me at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> How glad Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna
will be!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Varv&aacute;ra with vodka bottle,
which she sets on a table; no one
drinks from it yet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> Do you not want to drink tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Very much, you rogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> Then I will set the samovar for
both of you in here. [<i>She gets out tumblers,
lemon and sugar.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> I did wrong in moving the seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Put it back then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It is too late. Once it has been
moved, it must not be put back.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Prask&oacute;vya from the street
hurriedly with a lantern.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> [<i>crossing herself</i>]. H&oacute;spodi
B&oacute;zhe moy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> [<i>running to her, frightened</i>].
Have you seen him again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> [<i>agitated</i>]. I do not know.
There seemed to be men standing everywhere
in the shadows.... Good-evening,
Fom&aacute; Ilyitch, good-evening, Ast&eacute;ryi
Ivanovitch.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Varv&aacute;ra goes out, and brings in
the samovar.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> I have been making myself at
home; my stove smoked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Sit down, sit down! What
ceremony! Why should you not be here?
And vodka too? What is the vodka for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> I will tell you when I have finished
my patience. [<i>They all drink tea.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> So you are playing already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> If it comes out, the good luck
that it brings shall be for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> For me? [<i>They all watch Ast&eacute;ryi
playing.</i>] The knave goes on the
queen. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> That is unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> You should not have moved the
ten. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> That will be better. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> How brightly the eikon lamp
burns before the portrait of my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> It does indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> It is the new fire from the
Candlemas taper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It is the new oil that makes it
burn brightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> [<i>crossing herself</i>]. Nonsense! it
is the new fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Did ever one hear such stuff?
She put out the lamp at Candlemas, and
lighted it anew from the taper which she
brought home from the midnight service,
from the new fire struck by the priest
with flint and steel; and now she thinks
that is the reason why it burns so
brightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> Is that not so then, Ast&eacute;ryi
Ivanovitch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Oh, Fom&aacute; Ilyitch is a chemist;
he can tell you what fire is made of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> So you have been all the way
to St. Pantal&eacute;imon's in the Marsh? Oh,
piety, thy name is Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna!
Not a person can hold the most miserably
little service in the remotest corner
of the town but you smell it out and go
to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> It is a Christian deed, Fom&aacute;
Ilyitch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Now I can get at the ace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> [<i>to Prask&oacute;vya</i>]. I must get your
supper. [<i>She gets a plate of meat from
a cupboard.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> And on All Souls' Day she
brought home holy water in a bottle and
sprinkled the rooms of all the lodgers.
The schoolmaster was very angry. You
spotted the cover of his Greek Lexicon.
He says it is a pagan custom, come down
to us from the ancient Scythians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> I do not like to hear jokes
about sacred things. One may provoke
Heaven to anger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Now I get all this row off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> You are always afraid of offending
Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Of course I am. Think what I
have at stake. For you it is only a little
thing. You have a life of your own
on earth; I have none. I have been as
good as dead for twenty years, and the
only thing that I desire is to get safely
to heaven to join my son who is there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> We all wish to get to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Not so much as I do. If I
were in hell it is not the brimstone that
would matter; it would be to know that
I should not see my son. [<i>Fom&aacute; nods</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> I believe it is coming out.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They all concentrate their attention
eagerly on the patience.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> The six and the seven go.
Saints preserve us! and the eight. [<i>She
takes up a card to move it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> No, not that one; leave that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> Where did it come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> From here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> No, from there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> It was from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It is all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It will go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> And the knave from off this
row.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> The Wolf is going out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> It is seven years since it went
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Seven years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It is out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> It is done!</p>

the patience was done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> How much money have you
saved up for the house on Sasha's tomb?</p>

price?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> He will not lower his price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> What if he should say that he
would take 450 roubles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Why, if I went without food
for a year.... [<i>Laughing at herself.</i>]
If one could but live without food!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> What if he should say that he
would take 420 roubles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Ast&eacute;ryi Ivanovitch, you know
the proverb&mdash;the elbow is near, but you
cannot bite it. I am old and feeble. I
want it now, now, now. Shall I outlive
the bitter winter? A shelter to sit in
and talk to my son. A monument
worthy of such a saint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Spirid&oacute;n has been here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Spirid&oacute;n has been here? What

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He will build it for 400 roubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> For 400 roubles!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He will return soon to strike a
bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Is it true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> As true as that I wear the cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Var.</span> The face looked in at the window!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Whose face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Spirid&oacute;n will be returning soon.
Have you the money ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> The money? Yes, yes! I will

Varv&aacute;ra. [<i>They put on coats and

<p>So he was a saint, was he, that son of

that? Saints are not so easy to love as

in public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Oh, as for me, I keep mine in
a box under the bed; it only frightens
people. Do you think he would have remained
a saint all this time if he had
lived?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Who can say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Nonsense! He would have become
like the rest of us. Then why make
all this fuss about him? Why go on for
twenty years sacrificing her own life to
a fantastic image?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Why not, if it please her to
do so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Say what you please, but all
the same she is mad; yes, Prask&oacute;vya is
mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> We call every one mad who is
faithful to their ideas. If people think
only of food and money and clothing we
call them sane, but if they have ideas
beyond those things we call them mad.
I envy Prask&oacute;vya. Prask&oacute;vya has preserved
in her old age what I myself have
lost. I, too, had ideas once, but I have
been unfaithful to them; they have
evaporated and vanished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> What ideas were these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Liberty! Political regeneration!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Ah, yes; you were a sad revolutionary
once, I have been told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> I worshiped Liberty, as Prask&oacute;vya
worships her Sasha. But I have
lived my ideals down in the dull routine
of my foolish, aimless life as an office
hack, a clerk in the District Council,
making copies that no one will ever see
of documents that no one ever wants
to read.... Suddenly there comes the
Revolution; there is fighting in the
streets; men raise the red flag; blood
flows. I might go forth and strike a
blow for that Liberty which I loved
twenty years ago. But no, I have become
indifferent. I do not care who
wins, the Government or the Revolutionaries;
it is all the same to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> You are afraid. One gets timid
as one gets older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Afraid? No. What have I to
be afraid of? Death is surely not so
much worse than life? No, it is because
my idea is dead and cannot be
made to live again, while Prask&oacute;vya,
whose routine as a lodging-house keeper
is a hundred times duller than mine, is
still faithful to her old idea. Let us not
call her mad; let us rather worship her
as something holy, for her fidelity to an
idea in this wretched little town where
ideas are as rare as white ravens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> She has no friends to love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> She has never had any friends;
she needed none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> She has relatives, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> None.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> What mystery explains this solitude?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> If there is a mystery it is easily
guessed. It is an everyday story; the
story of a peasant woman betrayed and
deserted by a nobleman. She came with
her child to this town; and instead of
sinking, set herself bravely to work, to
win a living for the two of them. She
was young and strong then; her work
prospered with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> And her son was worthy of her
love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He was a fine boy&mdash;handsome
and intelligent. By dint of the fiercest
economy she got him a nobleman's education;
sent him to the Gymnase, and
thence, when he was eighteen, to the University
of Moscow. Prask&oacute;vya herself
cannot read or write, but her boy ...
the books on that shelf are the prizes
which he won. She thought him a pattern
of all the virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Aha! now we're coming to it!
So he was a sinner after all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> We are none of us perfect. His
friends were ill-chosen. The hard-earned
money that Prask&oacute;vya thought was spent
on University expenses went on many
other things&mdash;on drink, on women, and
on gambling. But he did one good thing&mdash;he
hid it all safely from his mother.
I helped him in that. Together we kept
her idea safe through a difficult period.
And before he was twenty it was all over&mdash;he
was dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Yes, he was murdered by some
foreigner, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> By Ad&aacute;mek, a Pole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> And what was the motive of
the crime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It was for money. By inquiries
which I made after the trial I ascertained
that this Ad&aacute;mek was a bad character
and an adventurer, who used to
entice students to his rooms to drink and
gamble with him. Sasha had become an
intimate friend of his; and it was even
said that they were partners in cheating
the rest. Anyhow, there is no doubt that
at one time or another they had won
considerable sums at cards, and disputed
as to the ownership of them. The last
thing that was heard of them, they
bought a sledge with two horses and set
out saying they were going to Tula. On
the road Ad&aacute;mek murdered the unfortunate
boy. The facts were all clear and
indisputable. There was no need to
search into the motives. The murderer
fell straight into the hands of the police.
The District Inspector, coming silently
along the road in his sledge, suddenly
saw before him the boy lying dead by
the roadside, and the murderer standing
over him with the knife in his hand. He
arrested him at once; there was no possibility
of denying it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> And it was quite clear that his
victim was Sasha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Quite clear. Ad&aacute;mek gave intimate
details about him, such as only a
friend of his could have known, which
put his identity beyond a doubt. When
the trial was over the body was sent in a
coffin to Prask&oacute;vya Petr&oacute;vna, who buried
it here in the Tr&oacute;itski Cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> And the Pole?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He was sent to penal servitude
for life to the silver mines of Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> So Prask&oacute;vya is even madder
than I thought. Her religion is founded
on a myth. Her life is an absurd deception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> No; she has created something
out of nothing; that is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> In your place I should have
told her the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Anything is better than a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> There is no lie in it. Prask&oacute;vya's
idea and Sasha's life are two independent
things. A statement of fact
may be true or false; but an idea need
only be clear and definite. That is all
that matters. [<i>There is a tapping at

you had seen a ghost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> A ghost? There are no such
things as ghosts. Would that it were a
ghost. It is Sasha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Sasha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> It is Prask&oacute;vya's son alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Prask&oacute;vya's son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> You remember me now, Ast&eacute;ryi

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> How have you risen from the
dead? How have you come back from
the grave&mdash;you who were dead and
buried these twenty years and more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> I have not risen from the
dead. I have not come back from the
grave; but I have come a long, long journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> From where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> From Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> From Siberia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> From Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> What were you doing in Siberia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Do you not understand, Ast&eacute;ryi
Ivanovitch? I am a criminal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> A convict, a felon. I have
escaped and come home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Of what crime have you been
guilty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Do not ask me so many questions,
but give me something to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> But tell me this....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> There is food here. I smelt
it as I came in. [<i>He eats the meat with
his fingers ravenously, like a wild beast.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> It is your mother's supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> I do not care whose supper it
is. I am ravenous. I have had nothing
to eat all day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> Can this wild beast be Prask&oacute;vya's
son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> We are all wild beasts if we
are kept from food. Ha! and vodka,
too! [<i>helping himself</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Are you a convict, a felon,
Sasha? You who were dead? Then we
have been deceived for many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Some other man was murdered
twenty years ago. The murderer said
that it was you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Ah, he said that it was me,
did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Why did Ad&aacute;mek say that it was
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Can you not guess? Ad&aacute;mek
murdered no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He murdered no one? But he
was condemned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> He was never condemned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Never condemned? Then what
became of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> He died.... Do you not understand?
It was I who killed Ad&aacute;mek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> You!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> We had quarreled. We were
alone in a solitary place. I killed him
and stood looking down at him with the
knife in my hand dripping scarlet in the
snow, frightened at the sudden silence
and what I had done. And while I
thought I was alone, I turned and saw
the police-officer with his revolver leveled
at my head. Then amid the confusion
and black horror that seized on me, a
bright thought shot across my mind.
Ad&aacute;mek had no relatives, no friends; he
was an outcast. Stained with his flowing
blood, I exchanged names with him;
that's the old heroic custom of blood-brotherhood,
you know. I named myself
Ad&aacute;mek; I named my victim Sasha. Ingenious,
wasn't it? I had romantic ideas
in those days. Ad&aacute;mek has been cursed
for a murderer, and my memory has been
honored. Alexander Petr&oacute;vitch has
been a hero; my mother has wept for
me. I have seen her in the graveyard
lamenting on my tomb; I have read my
name on the cross. I hardly know
whether to laugh or to cry. Evidently
she loves me still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> And you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Do I love her? No. There
is no question of that. She is part of a
life that was ended too long ago. I have
only myself to think of now. What
should I gain by loving her? Understand,
I am an outlaw, an escaped convict;
a word can send me back to the
mines. I must hide myself, the patrols
are everywhere.... Even here I am not
safe. [<i>Locks the street door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Why have you returned? Why
have you spoilt what you began so well?
Having resolved twenty years ago to
vanish like a dead man....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Ah! if they had killed me then
I would have died willingly. But after
twenty years remorse goes, pity goes,
everything goes; entombed in the mines,
but still alive.... I was worn out. I
could bear it no longer. Others were
escaping, I escaped with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> This will break her heart. She
has made an angel of you. The lamp is
always burning....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha</span> [<i>going to the eikon corner with
a glass of vodka in his hand</i>]. Aha!
Alexander Nevski, my patron saint. I
drink to you, my friend: but I cannot
congratulate you on your work. As a
guardian angel you have been something
of a failure. And what is this? [<i>taking
a photograph</i>]. Myself! Who would
have known this for my portrait? Look
at the angel child, with the soft cheeks
and the pretty curly hair. How innocent
and good I looked! [<i>bringing it
down</i>]. And even then I was deceiving
my mother. She never understood that
a young man must live, he must live.
We are animals first; we have instincts
that need something warmer, something
livelier, than the tame dull round of
home. [<i>He throws down the photograph;
Fom&aacute; replaces it.</i>] And even
now I have no intention of dying. Yet
how am I to live? I cannot work; the
mines have sucked out all my strength.
Has my mother any money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> [<i>to Fom&aacute;</i>]. What can we do with
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Has my mother any money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Money? Of course not. Would
she let lodgings if she had? Listen. I
am a poor man myself, but I will give
you ten roubles and your railway fare to

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> St. Petersburg? And what
shall I do there when I have spent the
ten roubles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> [<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>]. How
do I know? Live there, die there, only
stay away from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> What right have you to send
him away? Why do you suppose that
she will not be glad to see him? Let
her see her saint bedraggled, and love
him still&mdash;that is what true love means.
You have regaled her with lies all these
years; but now it is no longer possible.
[<i>A knocking at the door.</i>] She is at the
door.</p>

it. It is the hand of God that has led
him here. Go and unlock the door.

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Why is the door locked? Were
you afraid without old Prask&oacute;vya to protect
you? Here is the money. Now let
me count it. Have you two been quarreling?
There are fifty roubles in this
bag, all in little pieces of silver; it took
me two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> How you must have denied
yourself, Prask&oacute;vya, and all to build a
hut in a churchyard!</p>

money be spent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> You are so much in love with
your tomb-house, I believe that you would
be sorry if it turned out that your son
was not dead, but alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Why do you say such things?
You know that I should be glad. Ah!
if I could but see him once again as he
was then, and hold him in my arms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fom&aacute;.</span> But he would not be the same
now.</p>

been an outcast, living in degradation?</p>

Who has been drinking here? Something
has happened! Tell me what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> Your son is not dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> Not dead? Why do you say it
so sadly? No, it is not true. I do not
believe it. How can I be joyful at the
news if you tell it so sadly? If he is
alive, where is he? Let me see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ast.</span> He is here.</p>

not him ... my son whom I have loved
all these years, my son that lies in the
churchyard. [<i>To Sasha.</i>] Don't be cruel
to me. Say that you are not my son;
you cannot be my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> You know that I am your son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> My son is dead; he was murdered.
I buried his body in the Tr&oacute;itski
Cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> But you see that I was not
murdered. Touch me; feel me. I am
alive. I and Ad&aacute;mek fought; it was not
Ad&aacute;mek that slew me, it was....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> No, no! I want to hear no
more. You have come to torment me.
Only say what you want of me, anything,
and I will do it, if you will leave me in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> I want food and clothing; I
want shelter; I must have money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> You will go if I give you
money? Yes? Say that you will go, far,
far away, and never come back to tell
lies.... But I have no money to give;
I am a poor woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sasha.</span> Come, what's all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pras.</span> No, no! I need it; I can't spare
it. What I have I have starved myself

ten roubles I will give you, if you will
go far, far away....</p>

The tomb-house that we have planned together,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>The scene is the living-room in the
Davis's cottage in the hill country. An
old room low in the ceiling. Ann Davis
is at the table in the center of the room
untying a parcel. The door opens to
admit Tom Davis, a sturdy quarryman
dressed in his best and wearing a large
nosegay.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> Well, 'ast seed un?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ay, a seed un. 'Im and 'is ugly face&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann</span> [<i>untying her parcel</i>].'Tis 'er
dress come just in time an' no more from
the maker-up&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ef she wouldna do it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> But 'tis such long years she's
been a-waitin'.... 'Tis long years since
she bought t' dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> An' 'tis long years she'll be a
livin' wi' what she's been waitin' for;
'tis long years she'll live to think ower it
and watch the thing she's taken for her
man, an' long years that she'll find 'un
feedin' on 'er, an' a dreary round she'll
'ave of et....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> Three times she 'ave come to a
month of weddin' an' three times 'e 'ave
broke loose and gone down to the Mortal
Man an' the woman that keeps 'arf our
men in drink.... 'Tis she is the wicked
one, giving 'em score an' score again 'till
they owe more than they can ever pay
with a year's money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'Tis a fearful thing to drink....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> So I telled 'er in the beginnin'
of it all, knowin' what like of man 'e
was. An' so I telled 'er last night only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> She be set on it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> An', an' 'ere's t' pretty dress
for 'er to be wedded in....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> Twice she 'ave broke wi' 'im,
and twice she 'ave said that ef 'e never
touched the drink fur six months she
would go to be churched wi' 'im. She
never 'ave looked at another man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ay, she be one o' they quiet ones
that goes about their work an' never 'as
no romantical notions but love only the
more for et. There've been men come
for 'er that are twice the man that Bill
is, but she never looks up from 'er work
at 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> I think she must 'a' growed up
lovin' Bill. 'Tis a set thing surely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> An' when that woman 'ad 'im
again an' 'ad 'im roaring drunk fur a
week, she never said owt but turned to
'er work agin an' set aside the things
she was makin' agin the weddin'....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> What did 'e say to 'er?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Nowt. 'E be 'most as chary o'
words as she. 'E've got the 'ouse an'
everything snug, and while 'e works 'e
makes good money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> 'Twill not end, surely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> There was 'is father and two
brothers all broken men by it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She hears Mary on the stairs, and
they are silent.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> 'Ere's yer pretty dress, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Ay.... Thankye, Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'Twill be lovely for ye, my dear,
an' grand. 'Tis a fine day fur yer weddin',
my dear....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I'll be sorry to go, Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> An' sorry we'll be to lose ye....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I'll put the dress on.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She throws the frock over her arm
and goes out with it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> Another girl would 'a' wedded
him years ago in the first foolishness of
it. But Mary, for all she says so little,
'as long, long thoughts that never comes
to the likes o' you and me.... Another
girl, when the day 'ad come at last, would
'a' been wild wi' the joy an' the fear o' it.... But
Mary, she's sat on the fells
under the stars, an' windin' among the
sheep. D' ye mind the nights she's been
out like an old shepherd wi' t' sheep? D'
ye mind the nights when she was but a
lile 'un an' we found 'er out in the dawn
sleepin' snug again the side o' a fat ewe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'Tis not like a weddin' day for
'er.... If she'd 'ad a new dress, now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> I said to 'er would she like a
new dress; but she would have only the
old 'un cut an' shaped to be in the fashion.... Et
'as been a strange coortin',
an' 'twill be a strange life for 'em both,
I'm thinkin', for there seems no gladness
in 'er, nor never was, for she never was
foolish an' she never was young; but she
was always like there was a great weight
on 'er, so as she must be about the world
alone, but always she 'ave turned to the
little things an' the weak, an' always she
'ad some poor sick beast for tendin' or
another woman's babe to 'old to 'er breast,
an' I think sometimes that 'tis only because
Bill is a poor sick beast wi' a poor
sick soul that she be so set on 'im.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'E be a sodden beast wi' never a
soul to be saved or damned&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> 'Cept for the drink, 'e've been a
good son to 'is old mother when the others
'ud 'a' left 'er to rot i' the ditch, an' 'e
was the on'y one as 'ud raise a finger
again his father when the owd man, God
rest him, was on to 'er like a madman.
Drunk or sober 'e always was on 'is
mother's side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'Twas a fearful 'ouse that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> 'Twas wonderful that for all
they did to 'er, that wild old man wi' 'is
wild young sons, she outlived 'em all, but
never a one could she save from the curse
that was on them, an', sober, they was
the likeliest men 'n Troutbeck....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> 'Tis when the rain comes and t'
clouds come low an' black on the fells and
the cold damp eats into a man's bones
that the fearful thoughts come to 'im that
must be drowned or 'im go mad&mdash;an'
only the foreigners like me or them as 'as
foreign blood new in 'em can 'old out
again it; 'tis the curse o' livin' too long
between two lines o' 'ills.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> An' what that owd woman could
never do, d'ye think our Mary'll do it?
'Im a Troutbeck man an' she a Troutbeck
girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> She've 'eld to 'er bargain an'
brought 'im to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> There's things that a maid can
do that a wife cannot an' that's truth,
an' shame it is to the men. [<i>Comes a
knock at the door.</i>] 'Tisn't time for t'
weddin' folk.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tom goes to the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Gorm. 'Tis Mrs. Airey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Good day to you, Mrs. Airey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Good day to you, Ann Davis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> Good day to you, Mrs. Airey.
Will ye sit down?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She dusts a chair and Mrs. Airey sits
by the fireside. She sits silent for
a long while. Tom and Ann look
uneasily at her and at each other.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> So 'tis all ready for Bill's
wedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ay. 'Tis a fine day, an' the folks
bid, and the sharry-bang got for to drive
to Coniston, all the party of us. Will ye
be coming, Mrs. Airey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I'll not. [<i>Mrs. Airey sits
silent again for long.</i>] Is Mary in the
'ouse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> She be upstairs puttin' on 'er
weddin' dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> 'Tis the sad day of 'er life.... They're
a rotten lot an' who should
know et better than me? Bill's the best
of 'em, but Bill's rotten.... Six months
is not enough, nor six years nor sixty,
not while 'er stays in Troutbeck rememberin'
all that 'as been an' all the trouble
that was in the 'ouse along o' it, and so
I've come for to say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> She growed up lovin' Bill, and
'tis a set thing. She've waited long years.
'Tis done now, an' what they make for
theirselves they make, an' 'tis not for us
to go speirin' for the trouble they may
make for theirselves, but only to pray that
it may pass them by....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> But 'tis certain.... Six
months is not enough, nor six years, nor
sixty&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ann.</span> And are ye come for to tell
Mary this...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> This and much more....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And what 'ave ye said to Bill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Nowt. There never was a
son would give 'eed to 'is mother.... 'Tisn't
for 'im I'm thinkin', but for t'
children that she's bear 'im. I 'oped, and
went on 'opin' till there was no 'ope left
in me, and I lived to curse the day that
each one of my sons was born. John and
Peter are dead an' left no child behind,
and it were better for Bill also to leave
no child behind. There's a day and 'alf
a day o' peace and content for a woman
with such a man, and there's long, long
years of thinkin' on the peace and content
that's gone. There's long, long years of
watching the child that you've borne and
suckled turn rotten, an' I say that t'
birth-pangs are nowt to t' pangs that ye
'ave from the childer of such a man as
Bill or Bill's father.... She's a strong
girl an' a good girl; but there's this that
is stronger than 'er.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mary comes again, very pretty in

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why, mother ... 'tis kind of

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> The sun is shining and the bees
all out and busy to gather in the honey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> 'Tis the bees as is t' wise people

is hidden, and to work away in t' sun
when 'tis bright and light. 'Tis the bees
as is t' wise people that takes their men
an' kills 'em for the 'arm that they may
do, and it's us that's the foolish ones to
make soft the way of our men an' let
them strut before us and lie; and 'tis us
that's the foolish ones ever to give a
thought to their needs that give never a
one to ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> 'Tis us that's t' glorious ones
to 'elp them that is so weak, and 'tis us
that's the brave and the kind ones to let
them 'ave the 'ole world to play with
when they will give never a thought to us
that gives it t' 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> My pretty, my pretty, there's
never a one of us can 'elp a man that
thinks 'isself a man an' strong, poor fool,
an' there's never a one of us can 'elp a

through to t' bone, an' not one day can
you be a 'elp to such a man as this....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> There's not one day that I will
not try, and not one day that I will not
fight to win 'im back....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> The life of a woman is a sorrowful
thing....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> For all its sorrow, 'tis a greater
thing than t' life of a man ... an' so
I'll live it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Now you're strong and you're
young.&mdash;'Ope's with ye still and life all
before ye&mdash;and so I thought when my
day came, and so I did. There was a
day and 'alf a day of peace and content,
and there was long, long years of thinking
on the peace and content that are
gone.... Four men all gone the same
road, and me left looking down the way
that they are gone and seeing it all black
as the pit.... I be a poor old woman
now with never a creature to come near
me in kindness, an' I was such a poor
old woman before ever the 'alf of life was
gone, an' so you'll be if you take my son
for your man. He's the best of my sons,
but I curse the day that ever he was
born....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> There was never a man the like
of Bill. If ye see 'un striding the 'ill, ye
know 'tis a man by 'is strong, long stride;
and if ye see 'un leapin' an' screein' down
th' 'ill, ye know 'tis a man; and if we see
'un in t' quarry, ye know 'tis a strong
man....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> An' if ye see 'un lyin' drunk
i' the ditch, not roarin' drunk, but rotten
drunk, wi' 'is face fouled an' 'is clothes
mucked, ye know 'tis the lowest creature
of the world.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mary stands staring straight in
front of her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Is it for this that ye come to
me to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Ay, for this: that ye may send
'un back to 'is rottenness, for back to it
'e'll surely go when 'tis too late, an' you
a poor old woman like me, with never a
creature to come near ye in kindness,
before ever the bloom 'as gone from your
bonny cheeks, an' maybe childer that'll
grow up bonny an' then be blighted for
all the tenderness ye give to them; an'
those days will be the worst of all&mdash;far
worse than the day when ye turn for good
an' all into yourself from t' man that will
give ye nowt.... 'Tis truly the bees as
is the wise people....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It's a weary waitin' that I've
had, and better the day and 'alf a day of
peace and content with all the long years
of thinking on it than all the long, long
years of my life to go on waitin' and
waitin' for what has passed me by, for
if he be the rottenest, meanest man in t'
world that ever was made, there is no
other that I can see or ever will. It is no
wild foolishness that I am doing: I never
was like that; but it's a thing that's
growed wi' me an' is a part o' me&mdash;an'
though every day o' my life were set before
me now so I could see to the very
end, an' every day sadder and blacker
than the last, I'd not turn back. I gave
'im the bargain, years back now, and
three times e' 'as failed me; but 'e sets
store by me enough to do this for me a
fourth time&mdash;'Twas kind of ye to come....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> You're strong an' you're
young, but there's this that's stronger
than yourself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Maybe, but 'twill not be for
want o' fightin' wi' 't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> 'Twill steal on ye when you're
weakest, an' come on ye in your greatest
need....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It 'as come to this day an' there
is no goin' back. D' ye think I've not
seed t' soft, gentle things that are given
to other women, an' not envied them?
D' ye think I've not seed 'em walkin'
shut-eyed into all sorts o' foolishness an'
never askin' for the trewth o' it, an' not
envied 'em for doin' that? D' ye think
I've not seed the girls I growed wi' matin'
lightly an' lightly weddin', an' not envied
'em for that, they wi' a 'ouse an' babes an'
me drudgin' away in t' farm, me wi' my
man to 'and an' only this agin 'im? D'
ye think I've not been tore in two wi'
wantin' to close my eyes an' walk like
others into it an' never think what is to
come? There's many an' many a night
that I've sat there under t' stars wi' t'
three counties afore me an' t' sea, an' t'
sheep croppin', an' my own thoughts for
all the comp'ny that I 'ad, an' fightin'
this way an' that for to take 'up an' let
'un be so rotten, as ever 'e might be; an'
there's many an' many a night when the
thoughts come so fast that they hurt me
an' I lay pressed close to t' ground wi'
me 'ands clawin' at it an' me teeth bitin'
into t' ground for to get closer an' 'ide
from myself; an' many a night when I
sat there seein' the man as t' brave lad
'e was when I seed 'un first leapin' down
the 'ill, an' knowin' that nothin' in the
world, nothin' that I could do to 'un or
that 'e could do 'isself, would ever take
that fro' me.... In all my time o' my
weary waitin' there 'as never been a soul
that I told so much to, an' God knows
there never 'as been an' never will be a
time when I can tell as much to 'im....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> My pretty, my pretty, 'tis a
waste an' a wicked, wicked waste....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> 'Tis a day an' alf a day agin
never a moment....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> 'Tis that, and so 'tis wi' all
o' us ... an' so 'twill be.... God bless

<p>[<span class="smcap">The Scene</span> <i>is an ordinary tailor shop
two steps down from the sidewalk.
Mirror on one side. Equipment third
rate. Mrs. Solomon Lezinsky, alone in
the shop, is examining a torn pair of
trousers as Mrs. Rooney comes in.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>27 years old, medium
height and weight, dark, attractive. In
a pleased voice with a slight Yiddish
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'accept'">accent</ins></i>]. Mrs. Rooney!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney</span> [<i>30 years old. A plump
and pretty Irish woman</i>]. I only ran in
for a minute to bring you these. [<i>Holds
up a pair of roller skates and a picture
book.</i>] Eileen's out there in the carriage.
[<i>Both women look out at the
baby-carriage in front of the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Bring her in, Mrs.
Rooney. Such a beautiful child&mdash;your
Eileen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Can't stop&mdash;where's
the kids?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> The janitress takes
them to the moving pictures with her Izzy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> You wouldn't believe
the things I've run across this day, packing.
[<i>Puts down the skates.</i>] I'm thinking
these skates'll fit one of your lads.
My Mickey&mdash;God rest his soul!&mdash;used
to tear around great on them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Fine, Mrs. Rooney!
[<i>Examines the skates.</i> But couldn't
you save them for Eileen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure, she'd be long
growing up to them and they be laying
by gathering the rust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> My David and Julius
and Benny could die for joy with these
fine skates, I tell you, Mrs. Rooney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Here's an old book
[<i>hands Mrs. Lezinsky the book</i>], but too
good to throw away entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>opens the book</i>]. Fine,
Mrs. Rooney! Such a book with pictures
in it! My Benny's wild for picture
books. Julius reads, reads&mdash;always
learning. Something wonderful, I tell
you. Just like the papa&mdash;my Solly
ruins himself with his nose always stuck
in the Torah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> The Toro? 'Tis a book
I never heard tell of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> The law and the
prophets&mdash;my Solly was meant to be a
rabbi once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> A rabbi?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> You know what a
rabbi is by us, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Indeed, I know what a
rabbi is, Mrs. Lezinsky&mdash;a rabbi is a
Jewish priest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> You don't hate the
Jewish religion, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Every one has a right to
their own religion. Some of us are born
Jewish&mdash;like you, Mrs. Lezinsky, and
some are born Catholics, like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Catholics like you are
fine, Mrs. Rooney. Such a good neighbor!
A good customer, too! Why
should you move away now, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> The air in the Bronx
will be fine for Eileen. 'Tis a great pity
you couldn't be moving there, yourself.
With the fresh air and the cheap rent,
'twould be great for yourself and the
boys&mdash;not to mention the baby that's
coming to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Thank God, that don't
happen for a little while yet. But in the
hottest weather&mdash;maybe&mdash;some Septembers&mdash;even
so late yet&mdash;ain't it, Mrs.
Rooney? Always trouble by us. Such
expense, too. The agent takes the rent
to-day. With Solly's eyes so bad it's a
blessing when we can pay the rent even.
And the gas bills! So much pants pressing!
See? They send us this already.
[<i>Shows a paper.</i>] A notice to pay right
away or they shut it off. Only ten days
overdue. Would you believe it, Mrs.
Rooney? Maybe we catch up a little next
month. It don't pay no longer, this business.
And soon now another mouth to
feed, and still my Solly sticks by his
learning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> But he can't be a rabbi
now, can he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> He can't be a rabbi
now, no more, Mrs. Rooney, but such a
pious man&mdash;my Solly. He must be a
poor tailor, but he never gives up his
learning&mdash;not for anything he gives that
up. Learning's good for my David and
Julius and Benny soon, but it's bad for
my Solly. It leaves him no eyes for the
business, Mrs. Rooney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> And are the poor eyes
as bad as ever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> How should his eyes
get better when he gives them no chance?
Always he should have an operation and
the operation&mdash;it don't help&mdash;maybe.
[<i>Mrs. Rooney turns to the door.</i>] Must
you go so quick, Mrs. Rooney? Now
you move away, I never see you any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> The subway runs in
front of the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I tell you something,
Mrs. Rooney: Solly couldn't keep the shop
open without me. Sometimes his eyes go
back on him altogether. And he should
get an operation. But that costs something,
I tell you, Mrs. Rooney. The doctors
get rich from that. It costs something,
that operation. And then, sometimes,
may be it don't help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> 'Tis too bad, altogether.
[<i>Looks at the baby-carriage.</i>] Wait a
minute, Mrs. Lezinsky. [<i>Starts out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>as Mrs. Rooney goes</i>].
What is it, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney</span> [<i>just outside the door,
calls out</i>]. Something else&mdash;I forgot.
'Tis out here in the carriage.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Lezinsky threads a needle and
begins to sew buttons on a lady's
coat. Mrs. Rooney comes back
carrying a small square package
wrapped in newspaper.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Here's something.
You'll like this, Mrs. Lezinsky. It belongs
to Eileen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>looking out at the child
in the carriage</i>]. Was her collar stitched
all right, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> It was that. Fits her
coat perfect. See the new cap on her?
'Twas for her birthday I bought it. Three
years old now. Getting that big I can
feel the weight of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Such a beautiful little
girl, Mrs. Rooney! And such stylish
clothes you buy for her. My David
should have a new suit from his papa's
right away now. Then we fix the old
one over for Julius. Maybe my Benny
gets a little good out of that suit too,
sometime. We couldn't afford to buy new
clothes. We should first get all the wear
out of the old ones. Yes, Mrs. Rooney.
Anyhow, boys! It don't so much matter.
But girls! Girls is different. And such
a beautiful little girl like Eileen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> She'll be spoilt on me
entirely&mdash;every one giving her her own
way. [<i>In a gush of mother-pride.</i>] 'Tis
the darling she is&mdash;anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> O, Mrs. Rooney, I
could wish to have one just like her, I
tell you, such a beautiful little girl just
like her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Maybe you will, Mrs.
Lezinsky, maybe you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> She sleeps nice in that
baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> 'Tis the last time she
sleeps in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> The last time, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Her pa'll be after buying
me a go-cart for her now we're moving.
'Tis destroying me&mdash;the hauling
that up and down stairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Such a gorgeous baby-carriage&mdash;all
fresh painted&mdash;white&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> It's fine for them that
likes it. As for me&mdash;I'm that tired of
dragging it, I'd rather be leaving it behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>her face aglow</i>].
What happens to that carriage, Mrs.
Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> I'll be selling it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Who buys that carriage,
Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> More than one has
their eye on it, but I'll get my price.
Mrs. Cohen has spoke for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> How much you ask
for that carriage, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure, and I'd let it go
for a $5 bill, Mrs. Lezinsky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>her face falls</i>]. Maybe
you get that $5 ... Mrs. Rooney.
Those Cohens make money by that stationery
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> And sure, the secondhand
man would pay me as much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>longingly</i>]. My David
and Julius and Benny&mdash;they never had
such a baby-carriage&mdash;in all their lives
they never rode in a baby-carriage. My
babies was pretty babies, too. And
smart, Mrs. Rooney! You wouldn't believe
it. My Benny was the smartest of
the lot. When he was 18 months old, he
puts two words together already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> He's a keener&mdash;that
one. [<i>Unwraps the package.</i>] I'm clean
forgetting the basket. [<i>Holds it out to
Mrs. Lezinsky's delighted gaze.</i>] Now
there you are&mdash;as good as new&mdash;Mrs.
Lezinsky&mdash;and when you do be sticking
the safety pins into the cushion [<i>she points
out the cushion</i>] you can mind my Eileen.
Some of the pinholes is rusty like, but
the pins'll cover it&mdash;that it was herself
gave your baby its first present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> O, Mrs. Rooney, such
a beautiful basket! Such a beautiful,
stylish basket!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> And here's a box for the
powder. [<i>Opens a celluloid box and
takes out a powder puff.</i>] And here's
an old puff. Sure the puff will do if
you're not too particular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>handling the things</i>].
Why should I be so particular? In all
their lives my David and Julius and
Benny never had such a box and puff, I
tell you, Mrs. Rooney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney</span> [<i>points</i>]. Them little
pockets is to stick things in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Should you give away
such a basket, Mrs. Rooney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> What good is it but to
clutter up the closet, knocking about in
my way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> My David and Julius
and Benny, they never had such a basket,
but my cousin, Morris Schapiro's wife,&mdash;she
had such a basket&mdash;for her baby.
All lined with pink it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Pink is for boys. I
wanted a girl, having Mickey then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Me, too, Mrs. Rooney.
Three boys! Now it's time it should be a
little girl. Yes, Mrs. Rooney. A little
girl like Eileen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure, then, if you're
going by the basket 'tis a little girl you
have coming to you. Blue's for girls.... A
comb and a brush for it&mdash;you can
buy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Combs and brushes!
What should I do with combs and
brushes? My David and Julius and
Benny are all born bald.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure, Eileen had the
finest head of curls was ever seen on a
baby&mdash;little soft yellow curls&mdash;like the
down on a bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> If I should have a
little girl&mdash;like your Eileen&mdash;my David
and Julius and Benny&mdash;they die for joy
over their little sister, I tell you, Mrs.
Rooney. Yes, it should be a girl and I
name her Eileen. Such pretty names for
girls: Eileen and Hazel and Gladys and
Goldie. Goldie's a pretty name, too. I
like that name so much I call myself
Goldie when I go to school. Gietel's my
Jewish name. Ugly? Yes, Mrs. Rooney?
Goldie's better&mdash;much better. But
Eileen's the best of all. Eileen's a gorgeous
name. I name her Eileen, I do assure
you. She should have another name,
too, for Solly. Zipporah, maybe&mdash;for
her dead grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure, Eileen has a
second name: Bridget. 'Tis for my
mother in the old country. A saint's
name. Her father chose it for her.
Bridget's a grand name&mdash;that&mdash;too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Zipporah&mdash;that was
Solly's mother.... But I call her Eileen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> That's a grand compliment,
Mrs. Lezinsky, and 'tis myself would
stand godmother for her should you be
wanting me to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I'm sorry, Mrs.
Rooney, by our religion we don't have
such god-mothers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> I'll be running on now
not to keep you from your work and so
much of it with your poor man and the
drops in his sick eyes. Here! [<i>She puts
half a dollar into Mrs. Lezinsky's hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> For what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> For Mr. Lezinsky
stitching the collar on Eileen's coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>trying to make Mrs.
Rooney take it back</i>]. Mrs. Rooney&mdash;if
you wouldn't insult me&mdash;please&mdash;when
you bring all these lovely things....
[<i>Mrs. Rooney pushes the money
away.</i>] And so you sell that fine baby-carriage....
That carriage holds my
Benny, too, maybe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure. Easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> My David and Julius&mdash;they
could wheel that carriage. The
little sister sleeps in it. And my Benny&mdash;he
rides at the foot. $5 is cheap for
that elegant carriage when you should
happen to have so much money. I ask
my Solly. Do me the favor, Mrs. Rooney&mdash;you
should speak to me first before
you give it to Mrs. Cohen&mdash;yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> Sure I will. I'll be leaving
the carriage outside and carry the
child up. You and Mr. Lezinsky can be
making up your minds. [<i>Mrs. Rooney
looks through the window at a man turning
in from the street.</i>] Is it himself
coming home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Any time now, Mrs.
Rooney, he comes from the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> 'Tis not himself. 'Tis
some customer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>as the door opens</i>].
It's Mr. Rosenbloom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> See you later. [<i>Rushes
out. Through the window Mrs. Lezinsky
watches her take the child out of the
carriage.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>sighs, turns to her customer</i>].
O, Mr. Rosenbloom! Glad to
see you, Mr. Rosenbloom. You well now,
Mr. Rosenbloom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> Able to get around
once more, Mrs. Lezinsky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I hope you keep that
way. You got thinner with your sickness.
You lose your face, Mr. Rosenbloom.
[<i>He hands her a coat and a pair of
trousers.</i>] Why should you bother to
bring them in? I could send my David
or Julius for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> Right on my way
to the barber-shop. The coat's a little
loose now. [<i>Slips off his coat and puts
on the other.</i>] Across the back. See?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> He should take it in
a little on the shoulders, Mr. Rosenbloom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom</span> [<i>considers</i>]. It
wouldn't pay&mdash;so much alterations for
this particular suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> It's a good suit, Mr.
Rosenbloom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> He should just
shorten the sleeves. Those sleeves were
from the first a little too long.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He slips the coat off. Mrs. Lezinsky
measures coat sleeve against his
bent arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> About how much, Mr.
Rosenbloom? Say&mdash;an inch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> An inch or an inch
and a half&mdash;maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>measures again</i>]. I
think that makes them too short, Mr.
Rosenbloom. One inch is plenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> All right&mdash;one
inch, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> One inch.... All
right, Mr. Rosenbloom&mdash;one inch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> How soon will they
be ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Maybe to-morrow.
He lets all this other work go&mdash;maybe&mdash;and
sets to work on them right away
when he gets back home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> All right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I send my David or
Julius with them, Mr. Rosenbloom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> I'll stop in the evening
and try the coat on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Maybe it wouldn't be
ready to try on so soon&mdash;All right, Mr.
Rosenbloom, this evening you come in.
[<i>She calls after him as he goes out.</i>] O,
Mr. Rosenbloom! The pants? What
should he do to the pants?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom</span> [<i>from the doorway</i>].
Press them. [<i>He turns back.</i>] Press
the&mdash;whole thing&mdash;suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Press them. Sure.
Press the suit. A fine suit. Certainly a
fine piece of goods, Mr. Rosenbloom.
Did my husband make it up for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I thought so. Wears
like iron, too, this goods. Yes, Mr.
Rosenbloom? With one eye my husband
picks the best pieces of goods I tell you,
Mr. Rosenbloom.... He should shorten
the sleeves one inch.... All right, he
fixes it to your satisfaction, Mr. Rosenbloom&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> Yes, yes. [<i>Impatiently
edges toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> This evening you come
for them?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He nods and hurries out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Five dollars! [<i>Drops
everything and stands looking dreamily

that&mdash;[<i>Turns from the suit to a pair

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>comes in. Spare. Medium
height. Pronounced Semitic type. He
wears glasses with very thick lenses.</i>]
Where are the children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Mrs. Klein takes them
to the moving pictures with her Izzy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Always to the moving pictures!
The children go blind, too, pretty
soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> The doctor didn't
make your eyes no better, Solly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> How should he make them
better when he says all the time: "Don't
use them." And all the time a man must
keep right on working to put bread in the
mouths of his children. And soon, now,
another one comes&mdash;nebbich!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Maybe your eyes get
much better now when our little Eileen
comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Better a boy, Goldie: that
helps more in the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> It's time our David
and Julius and Benny should have a
little sister now. They like that. Such
another little girl like Mrs. Rooney's
Eileen. When it is, maybe, a girl, we call
her Eileen&mdash;like Mrs. Rooney's Eileen.
Such a gorgeous name&mdash;that Eileen!
Yes, Solly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Eileen! A Goy name!
She should be Rebecca for your mother
or Zipporah for mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Sure. Zipporah, too,
Solly&mdash;Eileen Zipporah! When there
should be sometime&mdash;another boy, Solly,
then you name him what you like. When
it a little girl&mdash;Eileen. I dress her up
stylish. Such beautiful things they have
in Gumpertz's window. And&mdash;Mrs.
Rooney sells her baby-carriage. [<i>Both
look out at the carriage.</i>] She gives it
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> She gives you a baby-carriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> For five dollars she
gives me that lovely carriage good as new&mdash;all
fresh painted white&mdash;and the little
Eileen Zipporah sleeps at the head and
Benny rides at the foot by his little sister.
So elegant&mdash;Solly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> I put my eyes out to earn
the bread and this woman&mdash;she should
buy a baby-carriage. Oi! Oi!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>points to carriage</i>].
Such a baby-carriage what Mrs. Rooney
has&mdash;it only happens to us once, Solly.
Only five one-dollars&mdash;all fresh painted
white&mdash;just like new&mdash;and such a cover
to keep out the sun. She gets a little
new go-cart for Eileen. Otherwise she
don't give up such an elegant carriage
what cost her more money than we could
even see at one time except for rents and
gas-bills. Five dollars is cheap for that
carriage. Five dollars is nothing for that
carriage I tell you, Solly. Nothing at
all. She sells it now before she moves
to the Bronx this afternoon. Such a bargain
we shouldn't lose, Solly&mdash;even if
we don't pay all the money right away
down. Yes, Solly? And Mrs. Rooney&mdash;she
gives our David and Julius and Benny
skates and a picture book&mdash;and their
little sister this fine basket. [<i>Shows him
the basket.</i>] Yes, Solly. Shouldn't we
make sure to buy this baby-carriage?
Only five dollars, Solly, this baby-carriage&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Baby-carriage! Baby-carriage!
If I had so much money for
baby-carriages I hire me a cutter here.
This way I go blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> No, but by reading
the Torah! And that way you lose good
custom, too. [<i>Wheedling him again.</i>]
Maybe you get good business and hire
you a cutter when the little Eileen comes.
Five dollars! Does that pay wages to
a cutter? Yes, Solly? But it buys once
a beautiful baby-carriage, and David
and Julius go wild to ride their little
sister in it&mdash;and Benny at the foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>waving his arms</i>]. I should
have a cutter not to lose my customers&mdash;and
this woman&mdash;she would have a
baby-carriage. I lose my eyes, but she
would have a baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> But it costs only five
dollars. What costs a cutter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> At Union wages! I might
as well ask for the moon, Goldie. Oi!
Oi! Soon we all starve together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> You hire you a cheap
hand here, Solly. He does pressing and
all the dirty work. He works and you
boss him around. That looks good to
the customers. Yes, Solly? And I save
up that five dollars soon and give it back
to you. Yes, Solly? Business goes better
now already when people come back
from the country and everything picks
up a little. I help now and we spare
that five dollars. Mr. Rosenbloom brings
us a little work. See? [<i>She points to
the coat.</i>] You should make the sleeves
shorter&mdash;one inch. Mr. Rosenbloom gets
thinner by his sickness. His clothes hang
a little loose on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>looks at the trousers</i>]. And
the pants?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Mr. Rosenbloom didn't
lose his stomach by his sickness. He only
loses his face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Such a <i>chutzpah</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Yes, nothing makes
Mr. Rosenbloom to lose his cheek, ain't
it, Solly? And plenty roast goose has
he to fill up his stomach. By us is no
more roast goose nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> We make up what we didn't
get here maybe in the world to come,
Goldie <i>leben</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Roast goose in the
world to come! Such a business!
Angels shouldn't eat, Solly. I take my
roast goose now&mdash;then I sure get it.... How
much you charge Mr. Rosenbloom
for this [<i>points to the suit</i>], Solly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> One dollar and a half&mdash;maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> For such a job my
cousin Morris Schapiro gets three dollars
and not too dear then. Everything goes
'way up and you stay 'way behind. You
should raise your prices. No wonder we
shall all starve together. It's not baby-carriages
what ruin us. Did our David
or Julius or Benny ever have such a baby-carriage?
No. But it is that you let
the customers steal your work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> All right&mdash;I charge two
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> What good should
half a dollar do? Three dollars, Solly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Two dollars. Three dollars
swindles him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> All right&mdash;then two
dollars. Fifty cents is fifty cents anyhow.
[<i>She goes up to him and presses
her face against his.</i>] Solly, leben,
shouldn't our David and Julius and
Benny have a baby-carriage for their
little sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Baby-carriage&mdash;Oi! Peace,
Goldie, my head aches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>picking up the trousers</i>].
How much for these, Solly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> One dollar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>derisively</i>]. One dollar
you say! And for the lady's coat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> A couple of dollars, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> A couple of dollars
anyway! And he thinks he does good
business when he charges a couple of
dollars anyway. And for that, my cousin,
Morris Schapiro charges three dollars
each. A couple of dollars! Your children
will be left without bread. [<i>He
mutters phrases from the Torah.</i>] You
hear me, Solly? [<i>He goes on with his
prayers.</i>] Prayers are what he answers
me. Soon you pray in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Woe is me! Woe is me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Could he even answer
me? Yes, if it was roast goose I was
asking for or black satin for a decent
<i>Shabbos</i> dress. But no! [<i>Satirically.</i>]
Maybe you even get roast goose from
your learning.... Yes&mdash;on account of
your praying we all have to go a begging
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> To-morrow is <i>Rosch Hoschana</i>,
Gietel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Does <i>Rosch Hoschana</i>
mean a roast goose by us? Does it even
mean a baby-carriage what costs five
dollars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Roast goose and baby-carriage!
You have no pious thoughts.... Go
away.... My head swims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> That comes by fasting.
Don't you fast enough every day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> She comes now to roast
goose again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> What should I care
for roast goose? <i>Rosch Hoschana</i> comes
next year again. But the baby-carriage&mdash;it
never comes again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Baby-carriage! Baby-carriage!
When you should fast and pray....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> What! Should I fast
and give our David and Julius and Benny
a shadow&mdash;maybe&mdash;for a little sister?...
But&mdash;yes&mdash;I fast, too ... that&mdash;even&mdash;for
such a baby carriage. O,
Solly&mdash;that much we all do&mdash;for our
little Eileen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>wearily, putting his hands
to his eyes</i>]. All right. How much
money have you got there&mdash;Gietel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>sweetly</i>]. Now call
me Goldie, Solly, so I know you ain't
mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Goldie&mdash;say it&mdash;Solly
leben&mdash;Go on&mdash;count it&mdash;Goldie.
[<i>She takes the money out and they count
it together.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>together</i>].
One.... [<i>Counting out another dollar
bill</i>]&mdash;Two.... [<i>Counting out a third
dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Three.... [<i>Counting out
a two-dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Five dollars.... [<i>Another
two-dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Seven dollars.... [<i>A
ten-dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Seventeen.... [<i>Another
ten-dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Twenty-seven.... [<i>The
last ten-dollar bill</i>]&mdash;Thirty-seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Thirty-seven dollars in all&mdash;the
rent and the gas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> And a little over,
Solly, to pay on the baby carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> And to-morrow <i>Rosch
Hoschana</i>. Shall we starve the children
on Rosch Hoschana?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> They could go a little
hungry once for their little sister,
Eileen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Don't be too sure, Goldie,
maybe another boy comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Well, even if&mdash;it
needs the fresh air, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>firmly after a moment's
thought</i>]. No, Goldie, it couldn't be
done. In the spring we buy a baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> You think she waits
till spring to sell that baby-carriage?
She sells it now before she moves away&mdash;now,
this afternoon, I tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Well, we buy another carriage,
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> You don't find such
a bargain again anytime. She gives it
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> My eyes get much better
soon&mdash;now&mdash;by the operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Operation! Operation!
Always operations! And the baby
comes. No carriage for our David and
Julius to wheel her in&mdash;with our Benny
at the foot&mdash;in the fresh air&mdash;and she
dies on us in the heat next summer&mdash;maybe&mdash;and
David and Julius and
Benny&mdash;they lose their little sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Didn't David and Julius
and Benny live without a baby-carriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Yes, a mile to the
park, maybe, and I carry them to the
fresh air. And a baby-carriage for her
costs five dollars. What time shall I
have for that with all the extra work
and my back broken? In such a baby-carriage
the little sister sleeps from morning
to night&mdash;on the sidewalk by the
stoop; she gets fat and healthy from that
baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> When I could pay for the
operation, maybe&mdash;then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>despairingly</i>]. Operations
again&mdash;always operations!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Go away, Goldie, I must
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I advise you not to
have that operation now. He steals your
money and don't help your eyes. Get
another doctor. But baby-carriages like
this ain't so plenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> God of Israel, shall I go
blind because you would have a baby-carriage
for our unborn son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> No, but by reading
the Torah&mdash;and that way you lose good
customers, too&mdash;and she shall die in the
heat because David and Julius cannot
push her in that baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Go away, Gietel, I have
work to do. Maybe you could rip out
the sleeves from Mr. Rosenbloom's coat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> I do anything&mdash;anything
you like, Solly, for that baby-carriage.... Yes,
I rip out the sleeves
when I finish sewing on the buttons.... I
do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;so we get
this baby carriage. We never get another
such carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> God of Israel, will she
never hear me when I say: No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Then&mdash;Mrs. Cohen&mdash;she
gets that baby carriage&mdash;and
every day of my life I see it go past my
window&mdash;and the little sister&mdash;she goes
without. [<i>She picks up Mr. Rosenbloom's
coat, looks it over and finds a
small wallet in the breast pocket. Tucks
the wallet into her bosom. Fiercely, half-aloud,
but to herself.</i>] No! No! Mrs.
Cohen shouldn't get that baby-carriage&mdash;whatever
happens&mdash;she shouldn't get it.
[<i>She crosses to the mirror, pulls the
wallet from her bosom, hurriedly counts
the money in it, glances at her husband,
then takes out a five-dollar bill. She
hears a noise outside and makes a move
as though to restore the money to the
wallet, but at the sound of steps on the
stoop, she thrusts the loose bill into her
bosom. As Mr. Rosenbloom comes in
she has only time to stick the wallet back
into the coat. Picks up the lady's coat
and sews on buttons vigorously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom.</span> I left my wallet in
that coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>with a motion of his head

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom</span> [<i>crosses to coat</i>].
You don't begin work on it, yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky</span> [<i>slowly puts her work

sew these buttons on, Mr. Rosenbloom.</p>

Mr. Rosenbloom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Rosenbloom</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. From

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky</span> [<i>under his breath, looking

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> No, no, Solly, you

Thirty-seven dollars we had. I have
given him back his five and thirty-seven
dollars remain. How is that, Gietel?
What is the answer to that?... She
cheats the customer and she cheats me....
Rather should I take my children

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Solly&mdash;Solly&mdash;I tell
you&mdash;the baby-carriage&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Out of my sight, woman;
I forbid you to come into this shop again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> O, Solly <i>leben</i>, that
couldn't be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> The mother of my children&mdash;she
sins&mdash;for a baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> Listen, Solly&mdash;I
didn't mean to keep that money. As
there's a God of Israel I didn't mean to
keep it. I should use it&mdash;just this afternoon&mdash;to
buy the baby-carriage&mdash;and
when the customers pay us&mdash;put the
money back before he misses it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Meshugge! So much money
isn't coming to us. And why should you
use Mr. Rosenbloom's money? Why
shouldn't you take it from the money you
had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> How could I use that
money? Don't you pay the rent this
afternoon to the agent? And they shut
off the gas when we don't settle: by five
o'clock they shut it off. And Mrs.
Rooney moves away&mdash;[<i>Breaks into sobbing.</i>]
and so&mdash;I thought I lose the baby-carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Gietel&mdash;Gietel&mdash;you are a&mdash;&mdash;.
I can't speak the word, Gietel&mdash;It
sticks in my throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> No, no, Solly, you
shouldn't speak that word. If I took it
to keep it maybe. But&mdash;no. I couldn't
do such a thing. Not for a million baby-carriages
could I do such a thing. Not
for anything could I keep what is not my
own&mdash;I tell you, Solly.... [<i>Pleadingly.</i>]
But just to keep it for a few
hours, maybe? Why should a man with
so much money miss a little for a few
hours? Then Mr. Rosenbloom&mdash;he comes
back in. I change my mind, but the door
opens and it is too late already. Solly
leben, did I keep it back&mdash;the five dollars?
I ask you, Solly? Didn't I give it
all into your hand? I ask you that, Solly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> Woe is me!&mdash;The mother
of my children&mdash;and she takes what is
not her own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> So much money and
not one dollar to pay Mrs. Rooney for the
baby-carriage! You see, Solly&mdash;always
fine-dressed people around&mdash;the mamas
and the little children all dressed fine&mdash;with
white socks and white shoes. And
our David&mdash;and our Julius&mdash;and our
Benny, even&mdash;what <i>must</i> they wear?
Old clothes! Yes. And to save the
money they should wear black stockings&mdash;and
old shoes. Never no pretty
things! And it's all the time work&mdash;work&mdash;work
and we never have nothing&mdash;no
new clothes&mdash;no pretty things&mdash;[<i>She
breaks down completely.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lezinsky.</span> So our children grow up
with the fear of God in their hearts&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lezinsky.</span> What should little
children know of all this pious business
when they must play alone on the stoop
with Izzi Klein together. For why?
The Cohen children shouldn't play with
our David and Julius and Benny. They
make a snout at them. The Cohens dress
them up stylish and they should play
with Gentile children. They push my
Benny in the stomach when he eats an
ice-cream cone, and they say&mdash;regular&mdash;to
my David and Julius: "Sheeny"&mdash;the
same as if they wasn't Jewish, too.... Just
for once I wanted something
lovely and stylish&mdash;like other people
have.... Then she asks&mdash;only five dollars
for the  baby-carriage&mdash;and&mdash;[<i>Choking
back a sob.</i>] Mrs. Cohen&mdash;now,
Mrs. Cohen&mdash;she gets it. She gets
it and I must want&mdash;and want. First
David&mdash;then Julius&mdash;then comes Benny&mdash;and
now the little sister&mdash;and never
once a baby-carriage! [<i>Sobs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney</span> [<i>taking in the situation</i>].
Mrs. Cohen&mdash;<i>she</i> gets it! Does she now?
Not if my name's Rooney does Mrs.
Cohen get it and she only after offering
to raise me a dollar to make sure of the
baby-carriage, knowing your sore need of
the same. Am I a lady or not, Mr.
Lezinsky? 'Tis that I want to know.
"I'll give you six dollars for it," says she
to me. Says I to her: "Mrs. Cohen&mdash;when
I spoke to you of that baby-carriage,"
says I, "it clean slipped me mind
that I promised the same to Mrs. Lezinsky.
I promised it to Mrs. Lezinsky long
ago," says I&mdash;and so I did, though I
forget to make mention of it to you at

pay for that baby-carriage we keep it,
Mrs. Rooney&mdash;[<i>Turns back to her husband,

the little sister&mdash;yes, Solly? [<i>She waits
and watches him with mute appeal, then,

it couldn't be done, Mrs. Rooney&mdash;[<i>Bravely.</i>]

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Rooney.</span> There now&mdash;no more

Each one carved strangely from a precious stone.<br />
Within the fairest, clad in purity,<br />
Our mother dwelleth immemorially:<br />
Moon-calm, moon-pale, with moon stones on her gown,<br />
The floor she treads with little pearls is sown;<br />

Too shadowy to tell, and some they kiss.<br />
But all to whom they come, my sisters say,<br />
Forthwith forget all joyance of the day,<br />
Forget their laughter and forget their tears,<br />

His nose grew dim, the people gave a shout,<br />
His red lips paled, both his blue eyes went out.<br />
There rose a sullen sound of discontent,<br />
The golden shower of rockets was all spent;<br />
He left off dancing with a sudden jerk,<br />
For he was nothing but a firework.<br />
The garden darkened and the people in it<br />
Cried, "He is dead,&mdash;the</i> Pierrot <i>of the minute!"</i><br />
<br />

The artist, after all, is a</i> Pierrot&mdash;<br />

<br />
<i>Then pardon my Moon Maid and me, because<br />
We craved the golden shower of your applause!<br />
Pray shrive us both for having tried to win it,<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>Interior of a cottage kitchen
in a Cornish fishing village. The walls
are distempered a pale blue; the ceiling
wooden and beamed. Middle of back
wall, a kitchen-range where fire is burning.
At back <span class="smcap">R.</span> is a door opening into
an inner room. At back <span class="smcap">L.</span> small cupboards.
At side <span class="smcap">L.</span> is a large kitchen-table
laid for tea under a window facing
sea. The floor is red brick. On mantelpiece,
white china dogs, clock, copper
candlesticks, tea-caddy, stirrups, and
bits. On walls, family framed photographs,
religious framed pictures. Below
table is a door leading into street.
Behind door, roller with hanging towel.
Usual kitchen paraphernalia, chairs, pots
and pans, etc. Cat basket with straw to
<span class="smcap">R.</span> of range. At back <span class="smcap">R.</span> is a wooden settle
with good upright sides. Joe Pengilly
is wiping his face and hands, having
just come in from the pump outside.
He sighs and glances uneasily at Kezia,
who has her back turned to him, and is
frying mackerel at the stove. He rolls
down his sleeves slowly and watches his
wife uneasily. He is dressed as a laborer&mdash;corduroy
trousers, hob-nailed
boots, blue-and-white shirt, open throat.
He takes down a sleeved waistcoat from
a peg behind the door and puts it on.
He is a slight man with thin light hair,
gentle in manner, but with a strong keen
face. Kezia is a little taller than Joe&mdash;slender
and graceful, with a clean cotton
dress fitting well to her figure; a clean
apron, well-dressed and tidy hair; good-looking
and energetic. Joe smiles to
himself and crosses his arms and shuffles
his feet as he looks towards Kezia.
Kezia turns round suddenly and looks at
him sideways, the cooking-fork in one
hand and the handle of the frying-pan
in the other. Joe sits down at table.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kezia.</span> Why didn't thee speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Nothin' to say, my dear.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe laughs and leans his arms on the
table as he looks at Kezia; his face
beams as he watches her landing
the fish from the bubbling fat to
a dish. She puts some on a plate
in front of Joe, and pours out tea
in a large cup. She suddenly looks
at him as he begins picking off the
tail of his mackerel with his fingers.</i>]</p>

as long as you've a mind to, and smoke

teasy. Women's the devil that way;
it's in their breed and bone, like fightin'

of honeymoon ways, and stamps on

cat out in the rain, never certain where
to put my feet. As it is, as you do
know, I cain't keep no dog for fear of
the mess its feet 'ud make on the floor;
I cain't have a magpie in a cage 'cause
its seed 'ud 'appen fall on the table.
I've got to walk ginger like a rooster in
wet grass for fear o' disturbin' the sand
on the clean floor, and I rubs my feet
on the mat afore I goes in to my meals
enough to split it in half. I gives in to
all things 'cause I was took captive over
them, in a manner of speaking, almost
afore I'd finished courting, and it takes
years to understand women's fancies!
It's worse nor any book learnin', is understandin'
women; and then, when you
think you've learnt 'em off by heart, any
man 'ud fail under a first standard examination
on 'em. [<i>He gets up and
shakes Joe by the shoulder.</i>] Listen to
me, mate! Bein' a real pal to thee, Joe,

there's time to alter things yet.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe suddenly gets up and goes to

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Fur what? It's no use
speakin' i' riddles, man. Trust or no
trust&mdash;that's my plan. Thee's the only
livin' man or woman, for the matter of
that, as I've blackened Jane Ann to, and
if it'll ease thy mind to tell what's worritin'
of thee, you do know it's as safe
as if you'd dropt your secret into the
mouth of a mine shaft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Done! Give me a hearing and

<p class="salute">[<i>Matthew cleans out the bowl of his

to-day?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Matthew winks at Joe and lights his
pipe again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> It's always some feeble
thing like that as makes confusion in a
house. Jane Ann began just like that.
Dirty boots in the best parlor was my
first offense, and it raised hell in our
house for nigh on a whole day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Well, I never! It was just the
same thing in a way with me. I soaked
the crusties in my tea this mornin' and
threw 'em to the cat under the table, and
I suppose I must 'ave put my foot in 'em,
for Kezia went off like a thing gone
mazy. She stormed and said&mdash;[<i>he sits
down and wipes his forehead again with
his handkerchief as he pauses</i>]&mdash;as she
were a fool to take me, and all sorts, and
then she cried fit to kill herself, and
when I spoke she told me to hold my
noise, and when I didn't speak she said
I'd no feelin's, and was worse nor a
stone. We scarcely spoke at dinner-time.
She said she wished she was dead,
and wanted her mother, and that, bein' a
man, I was worse nor a devil; and when
I kept on eatin' she said she wondered
the food didn't choke me, and when I
stopped eatin' she said I was never
pleased wi' nothin' she'd got ready for
me. My head is sore with the clang of
the teasy things she drove into me, and
I'm not good at replies, as you do know.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe ends in a weary voice and pokes
the fire listlessly. Matthew smokes
hard and his eyes are on the
ground.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Women be mysteries, and
without little uns they'm worse nor
monsters. A child do often alter and
soften 'em, but a childless woman is as
near a wolf as anything I do know.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe's elbows sink on his knees and
his hands support his woebegone
face. When he next speaks he has
a catch in his voice, and he speaks
quickly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> That's it, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Iss, mate! That's the mischief.
Unless&mdash;[<i>he looks up suddenly
at Joe</i>]&mdash;perhaps she be goin' to surprise
'e by telling 'e she be going to have a
little one. That would account for her
bein' teasy and moody.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe laughs sorrowfully.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Lor', I should be the first to
know that, surely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Not a bit of it. Women
loves secrets of that sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> No; 'tain't that at all. I only
wish it was, if what you say be true of
women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> True enough, my son. I
did the cutest day's work in my life when
I persuaded Jane Ann to take little Joe
to help we. I watched the two of 'em
together and found he caught his tongueing,
too, from she, but it had a sort of
nestle sound in it as if she were a-cuddlin'
of him. She've been gentler wi' me
ever since Joe come back again after his
long bout at home.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe scratches his head very thoughtfully;
a pause, in which he seems
to be thinking before speaking
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I don't know of no sister's child
to take on for Kezia at all. What's the
next remedy, think you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> A thrashin'.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe jumps up and stares at
Matthew.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Matthew looks on the ground and
taps it with his foot, and he does
not see that Joe is standing over
him with his hands clenched.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Shame on thee, mate! I feel
more like strikin' thee nor a female. I'm
sorry I told thee, if thee can offer no
more help than that. I'm not much of a
chap, but I've never struck a woman
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Strike on principle, then.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He still looks fixedly at the floor,
and Joe stands glaring at him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matthew.</span> Like the Almighty strikes
when He've got a lesson for we to learn,
which we won't learn without strikes and
tears. Nothin' is of no avail to stop His
chastisement if He do think it's goin' to
work out His plan for He and we, and
that's what I'm wanting of you to do by
your wife for her sake more than for
yours. Wives must learn to submit.
[<i>Harshly.</i>] It's Divine Providence as
'ave ordered it, and women be miserable,
like ivy and trailers of all sorts, if they've
no prop to bear 'em up. Beat her once
and it'll make a man of you and be a
life-long warnin' to she.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> But I love her, man! [<i>Softly.</i>]

me creep.</p>

his head repeatedly.</i>]</p>

How can you be sure of that at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathew.</span> I've traveled, as you do
knaw. I ain't been to Africa for nothin',

if I'd happened on afore I courted Jane
Ann would have got me through the marriage
scrimmage wi' no tiles off of my
roof. That's why I'm a warnin' of you
afore it's too late. Your woman be worth

her moods is off, and it's only lately her
'ave altered so, and I expect it's really
all my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathew.</span> Certainly it is; you've
never shown master yet, and you must
this very night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> [<i>Coughs nervously.</i>] How?</p>

She's more nor meat and drink to me;

she.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathew.</span> All the more reason to
beat her, and at once. [<i>Sternly.</i>] You'll
lose her, sure enough, if you don't. It's
the only chance for thee now, and I do

at it at once, and she'll have time to come
round before you settle for the night.

basket in her hand again, looks at
the clock and goes into the inner

her hands, singing a lullaby as she
does so. She then stands facing

sings. So absorbed is she in her
thoughts that she does not see the
street-door open and the white,
scared face of Joe appear. He
puts his hands behind his back

never sees him till he has sat down
swiftly on the settle, the further
corner to where she stands. His
left hand, with the cane in it, is
not visible to Kezia, as it is hidden
by the end of the settle. Tying a
large plait on one side of her head&mdash;the
nearest to him&mdash;with pink
ribbon, she suddenly turns round

and whispers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Kezia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kezia</span> [<i>softly</i>]. Joey, my dear! [<i>She
nestles closer to him and puts her head
on his shoulder.</i>] He'll be the dearest
little thing a woman ever bore.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe laughs softly, kisses Kezia gently
on the eyes, brow, and then
month, and holds her closely to
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Heaven cain't be more desirable
than this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kezia.</span> To think there'll be three of
us soon. You see now why I've been so
teasy lately. Now I'll sing all day long
so he'll be a happy boy.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe does not move. He makes furtive
attempts to hide the cane behind
the settle, and moves a little
as he continues to smile at Kezia.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kezia.</span> Thee'rt smiling, Joe! Thee
and me 'ave both hungered for the same
thing. Did thee guess it at all, I wonder?
I've kept it from thee a while to make
sure. But, lor'! my dear life! whatever
be this that you've got here? [<i>She pulls
the long cane out of Joe's hands and holds
it in hers. They both look at it very
solemnly for a few moments, and Joe
scratches his head sadly, unable to speak.
She bursts into a merry laugh and her
lips tremble.</i>] Eh! Joe! lad! [<i>softly.</i>]
Thee was always unlike other chaps;
that's why I do love thee so. Fancy thee
guessing, and going to buy him somethin'
right away! [<i>She puts her face in
her hands and sobs and laughs together.</i>]
Oh! it brings it so near like. Most men
would have thought of a cradle or a
rattle, but thee! Oh! my dear! [<i>She
throws her arms round his neck and kisses
him on the mouth.</i>] Thee thought of the
first beatin' we should be forced to give
him, for, of course, he'll be a lad of tremenjous
spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>suddenly, and snatching the
cane from Kezia.</i>] So he will. Both his
father and mother be folk of great spirit,
and&mdash;the first time as he dirts the tablecloth
or frets his mother, I'll lay it on
him as, thanks be, I've never laid it on
nobody yet.</p>

<p>[<i>Before the curtain rises the orchestra
will play the Woodland Music (cuckoo)
from "Hansel and Gretel" and possibly
some of the Grieg Pastoral Music from
"Peer Gynt," or some Gabri&eacute;l Faur&eacute;.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A glade in a wood. About <span class="smcap">C.</span>
a great beech-tree, the branches of which
overhang the stage, the brilliant sunlight
filtering through them. The sky where
it can be seen through the branches is a
cloudless blue.</i></p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises Cecil Harburton
is discovered sitting on the ground
under the tree, leaning his back against
its trunk and reading a book. He wears
a straw hat and the lightest of gray flannel
suits. The chattering of innumerable
small birds is heard while the curtain
is still down, and this grows louder
as it rises, and we find ourselves in the
wood. Presently a wood pigeon coos in
the distance. Then a thrush begins to
sing in the tree above Cecil's head and is
answered by another. After a moment
Cecil looks up.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> By Jove, that's jolly! [<i>Listens
for a moment, then returns to his
book.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Suddenly a cuckoo begins to call
insistently. After a moment or two
he looks up again.</i>]</p>

<p>Cuckoo too! Bravo! [<i>Again he returns
to his book.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A moment later enter Evelyn
Rivers. She also wears the lightest
of summer dresses, as it is
a cloudless day in May. On her
head is a shady straw hat. As
she approaches the tree a twig
snaps under her foot and Cecil
looks up. He jumps to his feet,
closing book, and advances to her,
eagerly holding out his right hand,
keeping the book in his left.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Reproachfully.</i>] Here you are at last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> At last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. You're awfully late!
[<i>Looks at watch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> YOU know you are. I expected
you at three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Why? I never said I'd come
at three. Indeed, I never said I'd come
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> No.&mdash;But it's always been
three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Has it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> And now it's half-past. I consider
I've been cheated out of a whole
half-hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I couldn't help it. Mother
kept me. She wanted the roses done in
the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> How stupid of Mrs. Rivers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Mr. Harburton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I don't think you <i>ought</i> to
call my mother stupid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Why not&mdash;if she is stupid?
Most parents are stupid, by the way. I've
noticed it before. Mrs. Rivers ought to
have thought of the roses earlier. The
morning is the proper time to gather
roses. Didn't you tell her that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I'm afraid I couldn't very
well. You see it was really I who ought
to have thought of the roses! I always
do them. But this morning I forgot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I see. [<i>Turning towards the
tree.</i>] Well, sit down now you are here.
Isn't it a glorious day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. I don't believe I
ought to sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>  [<i>turns to her</i>]. Why not?
There's no particular virtue about standing,
is there? I hate standing. So let's
sit down and be comfortable.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She sits, so does he. She sits on
bank under tree, left of it. He sits
below bank to right of tree.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> But <i>ought</i> I to be sitting here
with you? That's what I mean. It's&mdash;not
as if I really <i>knew</i> you, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Not <i>know</i> me? [<i>The chatter
of birds dies away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Not properly&mdash;we've never
even been introduced. We just met quite
by chance here in the wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. [<i>Ecstatically.</i>] What a
glorious chance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Still, I'm sure mother
wouldn't approve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> And <i>you</i> say Mrs. Rivers isn't
stupid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. I expect most
people would agree with her. Most people
would say you oughtn't to have
spoken to a girl you didn't know like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Oh, come, I only asked my way
back to the inn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> There was no harm in asking
your way, of course. But then we began
talking of other things. And then we
sat down under this tree. And we've sat
under this tree every afternoon since.
And that was a week ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Well, it's such an awfully jolly
tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I don't know <i>what</i> mother
would say if she heard of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Would it be something unpleasant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>ruefully</i>]. I'm afraid it
would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>. How fortunate you don't know
it then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>pondering</i>]. Still, if I really
<i>oughtn't</i> to be here.... Do <i>you</i> think I
oughtn't to be here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I don't think I should go into
that if I were you. Sensible people think
of what they want to do, not of what they
<i>ought</i> to do, otherwise they get confused.
And then of course they do the wrong
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> But if I do what I oughtn't,
I generally find I'm sorry for it afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Not half sorry as you would
have been if you hadn't done it. In this
world the things one regrets are the things
one hasn't done. For instance, if I
hadn't spoken to you a week ago here in
the wood I should have regretted it all
my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Would you?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He nods.</i>]</p>

<p>Really and truly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>nods</i>]. Really and truly.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He lays his hand on hers for a moment,
she lets it rest there. Cuckoo
calls loudly once or twice&mdash;she
draws her hand away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> There's the cuckoo.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Cecil rises and sits up on bank R.
of her, leaning against tree.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. Isn't he jolly? Don't
you love cuckoos?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> They <i>are</i> rather nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Aren't they! And such clever
beggars. Most birds are fools&mdash;like
most people. As soon as they're grown
up they go and get married, and then the
rest of their lives are spent in bringing
up herds of children and wondering how
on earth to pay their school-bills. Your
cuckoo sees the folly of all that. No
school-bills for <i>her</i>! No nursing the
baby! She just flits from hedgerow to
hedgerow flirting with other cuckoos.
And when she lays an egg she lays it in
some one else's nest, which saves all the
trouble of housekeeping. Oh, a wise
bird!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>pouting, looking away from
him</i>]. I don't know that I <i>do</i> like cuckoos
so much after all. They sound to me
rather selfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. But so sensible! The
duck's a wise bird too in her way. [<i>She
turns to him.</i>] But <i>her</i> way's different
from the cuckoo's. [<i>Matter-of-fact.</i>]
She always <i>treads</i> on <i>her</i> eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Clumsy creature!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Not a bit. She does it on purpose.
You see, it's much less trouble
than <i>sitting</i> on them. As soon as she's
laid an egg she raises one foot absent-mindedly
and gives a warning quack.
Whereupon the farmer rushes up, takes it
away, and puts it under some wretched
hen, who has to do the sitting for her. I
call that genius!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Genius!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. Genius is the infinite
capacity for making other people take
pains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> How can you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I didn't. Carlyle did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I don't believe he said anything
of the kind. And I don't believe
ducks are clever one bit. They don't
look clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> That's part of their cleverness.
In this world if one <i>is</i> wise one should
look like a fool. It puts people off their
guard. That's what the duck does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Well, I think ducks are horrid,
and cuckoos, too. And I believe most
birds <i>like</i> bringing up their chickens and
feeding them and looking after them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> They do. That's the extraordinary
part of it. They spend their whole
lives building nests and laying eggs and
hatching them. And when the chickens
come out the father has to fuss round
finding worms. And the nest's abominably
over-crowded and the babies are perpetually
squalling, and that drives the
husband to the public house, and it's all
as uncomfortable as the Devil&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Mr. Harburton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>. Well, <i>I</i> shouldn't like it. In
fact, I call it fatuous.</p>

<p>[<i>Evelyn is leaning forward pondering
this philosophy with a slightly puckered
brow&mdash;a slight pause</i>]. I say, <i>you</i> don't
look a bit comfortable like that. Lean
back against the tree. It's a first-rate
tree. That's why I chose it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>tries and fails</i>]. I can't.
My hat gets in the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Take it off then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I think I will. [<i>Does so.</i>]
That's better. [<i>Leans back luxuriously
against the trunk; puts her hat down on
bank beside her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Much better. [<i>Looks at her
with frank admiration.</i>] By Jove, you
<i>do</i> look jolly without your hat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Do I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes. Your hair's such a jolly
color. I noticed it the first time I saw
you. You had your hat off then, you
know. You were walking through the
wood fanning yourself with it. And
directly I caught sight of you the sun
came out and simply flooded your hair
with light. And there was the loveliest
pink flush on your cheeks, and your eyes
were soft and shining&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>troubled</i>]. Mr. Harburton,
you mustn't say things to me like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Mustn't I? Why not? Don't
you like being told you look jolly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>na&iuml;vely</i>]. I do <i>like</i> it, of
course. But <i>ought</i> you...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>groans</i>]. Oh, it's <i>that</i> again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I mean, it's not <i>right</i> for men
to say those things to girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I don't see that&mdash;if they're
true. You <i>are</i> pretty and your eyes <i>are</i>
soft and your cheeks&mdash;why, they're
flushing at this moment! [<i>Triumphant.</i>]
Why shouldn't I say it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Please!... [<i>She stops, and
her eyes fill with tears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>much concerned</i>]. Miss Rivers,
what's the matter? Why, I believe you're
crying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>sniffing suspiciously</i>]. I'm ... not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> You are, I can see the tears.
Have I said anything to hurt you? What
is it? Tell me. [<i>Much concerned.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>recovering herself by an effort</i>].
It's nothing, nothing really. I'm
all right now. Only you won't say things
to me like that again, will you? Promise.
[<i>Taking out handkerchief.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I promise ... if you really
wish it. And now dry your eyes and let's
be good children. That's what my nurse
used to say when my sister and I quarreled.
Shall I dry them for you?
[<i>Takes her handkerchief and does so
tenderly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>with a gulp</i>]. Thank you.
[<i>Takes away handkerchief.</i>] How absurd
you are! [<i>Puts it away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Thank <i>you</i>!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Evelyn moves down, sitting at bottom
of bank, a little below him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Did you often quarrel with
your sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Perpetually. <i>And</i> my brothers.
Didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I never had any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Poor little kid. You must
have been rather lonely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>matter-of-fact</i>]. There was
always Reggie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Reggie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> My cousin, Reggie Townsend.
He lived with us when we were
children. His parents were in India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>matter-of-fact</i>]. So he used to
quarrel with you instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. Oh no! We <i>never</i>
quarreled. At least, Reggie never did.
<i>I</i> did sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> How dull! There's no good
in quarreling if people won't quarrel
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I don't think there's any
good in quarreling at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Oh, yes, there is. There's the
making it up again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Was that why you used to
quarrel with your sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I expect so, though I didn't
know it, of course&mdash;then. I used to
tease her awfully, I remember, and pull
her hair. She had awfully jolly hair.
Like yours&mdash;oh! I forgot, I mustn't say
that. Used you to pull Reggie's hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. I'm afraid I did
sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I was sure of it. How long
was he with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Till he went to Winchester.
And of course he used to be with us in
the holidays after that. And he comes
to us now whenever he can get away for
a few days. He's in his uncle's office in
the city. He'll be a partner some day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Poor chap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> <i>Poor</i> chap! Mother says
he's very <i>fortunate</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> She would. Parents always
think it very fortunate when young men
have to go to an office every day. I
know mine do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> <i>Do</i> you go to an office every
day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>with dignity</i>]. Then I don't
think you can know much about it, can
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>carelessly</i>]. I know too much.
That's why I don't go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> What <i>do</i> you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I don't do anything. I'm at
the Bar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> If you're at the Bar, why are
you down here instead of up in London
working?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Because if I were in London I
might possibly get a brief. It's not likely,
but it's possible. And if I got a brief
I should have to be mugging in chambers,
or wrangling in a stuffy court, instead of
sitting under a tree in the shade with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> But <i>ought</i> you to waste your
time like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>genuinely shocked</i>]. <i>Waste</i> my
time! To sit under a tree&mdash;a really nice
tree like this&mdash;talking to you. You can
call that <i>wasting time</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> No! To sit in a frowsy office
adding up figures when the sky's blue and
the weather's heavenly, <i>that's</i> wasting
time. The only real way in which one
can waste time is not to enjoy it, to spend
one's day blinking at a ledger and never
notice how beautiful the world is, and
how good it is to be alive. To be only
making money when one might be making
love, <i>that</i> is wasting time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> How earnestly you say that!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Cecil leans forward&mdash;close to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Isn't it true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>troubled</i>]. Perhaps it is.
[<i>Looks away from him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> You know it is. Every one
knows it. Only people won't admit it.
[<i>Leaning towards her and looking into
her eyes.</i>] You know it at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>returning his gaze slowly</i>].
I think I do.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>For a long moment they look into
each other's eyes. Then he takes
her two hands, draws her slowly
towards him and kisses her gently
on the lips.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Ah! [<i>Sigh of satisfaction.
He releases her hands and leans back
against the tree again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Oh, Mr. Harburton,
you <i>oughtn't</i> to have done that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Because.... [<i>Hesitates.</i>]
Because you <i>oughtn't</i>.... Because men
<i>oughtn't</i> to kiss girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>scandalized</i>]. Oughtn't to kiss
girls! What nonsense! What on earth
were girls made for if not to be kissed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I mean they <i>oughtn't</i> ...
unless.... [<i>Looking away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. Unless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>looking down</i>]. Unless they
<i>love</i> them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>relieved</i>]. But I <i>do</i> love you.
Of course I love you. That's why I
kissed you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A thrush is heard calling in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Really? [<i>Cecil nods. Evelyn
sighs contentedly.</i>] That makes it all
right then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I should think it did. And as
it's all right I may kiss you again,
mayn't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shyly</i>]. If you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> You darling! [<i>Takes her in
his arms and kisses her long and tenderly.</i>]
Lean your head on my shoulder,
you'll find it awfully comfortable. [<i>He
leans back against the tree.</i>] [<i>She does
so.</i>] There! Is that all right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Quite. [<i>Sigh of contentment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> How pretty your hair is! I always
thought your hair lovely. And it's
as soft as silk. I always knew it would
be like silk. [<i>Strokes it.</i>] Do you like
me to stroke your hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Sensible girl! [<i>Pause; he
laughs happily.</i>] I say, what am I to
call you? Do you know, I don't even
know your Christian name yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> No. You've never told me.
What is it? Mine's Cecil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Mine's Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Evelyn? Oh, I don't like Evelyn.
It's rather a <i>stodgy</i> sort of name. I
think I shall call you Eve. Does any one
else call you Eve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Then I shall certainly call you
Eve. After the first woman man ever
loved. May I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> If you like&mdash;Cecil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> That's settled then.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He kisses her again. Pause of utter
happiness, during which he settles
her head more comfortably on
his shoulder, and puts arm round
her.</i>]</p>

<p>Isn't it heavenly to be in love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Heavenly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> There's nothing like it in the
whole world! Say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Love is the most beautiful
thing in the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Good girl! There's a reward
for saying it right. [<i>Kisses her.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pause of complete happiness for
both.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>meditatively</i>]. I'm afraid
Reggie won't be pleased.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The chatter of sparrows is heard.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. Won't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shakes her head</i>]. No. You
see, Reggie's in love with me too. He always
has been in love with me, for years
and years. [<i>Sighs.</i>] Poor Reggie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> On the contrary. Happy Reggie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>astonished</i>]. What <i>do</i> you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> To have been in love with you
years and years. <i>I've</i> only been in love
with you a week.... I've only known
you a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I'm afraid Reggie didn't look
at it like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>nods</i>]. No brains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> You see, I always refused
<i>him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Exactly. And he always went
on loving you. What more could the silly
fellow want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shyly, looking up at him</i>].
He <i>wanted</i> me to accept him, I suppose.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The bird chatter dies away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Ah!... Reggie ought to read
Keats's "Ode to a Grecian Urn."... I
say, what jolly eyes you've got! I noticed
them the moment we met here in
the wood. That was why I spoke to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>demurely</i>]. I thought it was
to ask your way back to the inn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> That was an excuse. I knew
the way as well as you did. I'd only just
come from there. But when I saw you
with the sunshine on your pretty soft
hair and lighting up your pretty soft
eyes, I said I <i>must</i> speak to her. And
I did. Are you glad I spoke to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Glad and glad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Good girl! [<i>Leans over and
kisses her cheek.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>sigh of contentment; sits up</i>].
And now we must go and tell mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>with a comic groan</i>]. Need we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>brightly</i>]. Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>sigh</i>]. Well, if <i>you</i> think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. You don't seem
to look forward to it much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I don't. That's the part I always
hate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> <i>Always?</i> [<i>Starts forward
and looks at him, puzzled.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>quite unconscious</i>]. Yes. The
going to the parents and all that. Parents
really are the most preposterous people.
They've no feeling for <i>romance</i>
whatever. You meet a girl in a wood.
It's May. The sun's shining. There's
not a cloud in the sky. She's adorably
pretty. You fall in love. Everything
heavenly! Then&mdash;why, I can't imagine&mdash;she
wants you to tell her mother.
Well, you do tell her mother. And her
mother at once begins to ask you what
your profession is, and how much money
you earn, and how much money you have
that you don't earn&mdash;and that spoils it
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>bewildered</i>]. But I don't understand.
You talk as if you had actually
done all this before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> So I have. Lots of times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Oh! [<i>Jumps up from the
ground and faces him, her eyes flashing
with rage.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I say, don't get up. It's not
time to go yet. It's only four. Sit down
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>struggling for words</i>]. Do
you mean to say you've been in love with
girls before? <i>Other</i> girls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>apparently genuinely astonished
at the question</i>]. Of course I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> And been engaged to them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>. Not engaged. I've never been
engaged so far. But I've been in love
over and over again.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Evelyn stamps her foot with rage&mdash;turning
away from him.</i>]</p>

<p>My dear girl, what <i>is</i> the matter? You
look quite cross. [<i>Rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>furious</i>]. And you're not
even <i>ashamed</i> of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>roused to sit up by this question</i>].
Ashamed of it? Ashamed of being
in love? How can you say such a
thing! Of course I'm not ashamed.
What's the good of being alive at all if
one isn't to be in love? I'm perpetually
in love. In fact, I'm hardly ever out of
love&mdash;with somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>still furious</i>]. Then if you're
in love, why don't you get engaged? A
man has no business to make love to a
girl and not be engaged to her. It's not
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>reasoning with her</i>]. That's the
parents' fault. I told you parents were
preposterous people. They won't allow
me to get engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>. Oh, for different reasons.
They say I'm not <i>serious</i> enough. Or
that I don't work enough. Or that I
haven't got enough money. Or else they
simply say they "don't think I'm fitted to
make their daughter happy." Anyhow,
they won't sanction an engagement. They
all agree about <i>that</i>. Your mother
would be just the same.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Impatient exclamation from Evelyn.</i>]</p>

<p>I don't blame her. I don't say she's not
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'right. don't'">right. I don't</ins> say they haven't all been
right. In fact, I believe they <i>have</i> been
right. I'm only explaining how it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>savagely</i>]. I see how it is.
You don't really want to be married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Of course I don't <i>want</i> to be
married. Nobody does unless he's perfectly
idiotic. One wants to be in love.
Being in love's splendid. And I dare
say being engaged isn't bad&mdash;though I've
had no experience of that so far. But
being married must be simply hateful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>boiling with rage</i>]. Nonsense!
How can it be hateful to be married
if it's splendid to be in love?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The cuckoo is heard.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Have you forgotten the cuckoo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Oh!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span>. No ties, no responsibilities, no
ghastly little villa with children bellowing
in the nursery. Just life in the
open hedgerow. Life and love. Happy
cuckoo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>furious</i>]. I think cuckoos detestable.
They're mean, horrid, <i>disgusting</i>
birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> No. No. I can't have you
abusing cuckoos. They're particular
friends of mine. In fact, I'm a sort of
cuckoo myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>turning on him</i>]. Oh, I hate
you! I hate you! [<i>Stamps her foot.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>with quiet conviction</i>]. You
don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>shaking his head</i>]. You don't.
[<i>Quite gravely.</i>] One never really hates
the people one has once loved.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He looks into her eyes. For a moment
or two she returns his gaze
fiercely. Then her eyes fall and
they fill with tears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>half crying</i>]. How horrid
you are to say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Because it's true, I suppose.
Ah, I'm so unhappy! [<i>Begins to cry.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>genuinely distressed</i>]. Eve!
You're crying. You mustn't do that. I
can't bear seeing people cry. [<i>Lays
hand on her shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shaking it off</i>]. Don't. I
can't bear you to touch me. After falling
in love with one girl after another
like that. When I thought you were only
in love with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> So I am only in love with you&mdash;now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>tearfully</i>]. But I thought
you'd never been in love with any one
else. And I let you call me Eve because
you said she was the first woman man
ever loved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> But I never said she was the
only one, did I? [<i>Argumentatively.</i>]
And one can't help being in love with
people when one <i>is</i> in love, can one? I
couldn't <i>help</i> falling in love with you, for
instance, the moment I saw you. You
looked simply splendid. It was such a
splendid day too. <i>Of course</i> I fell in
love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>slightly appeased by his compliment,
drying her eyes</i>]. But you seem
to fall in love with such a lot of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I do. [<i>Mischievously.</i>] But
ought <i>you</i> to throw stones at me? After
all, being in love with more than one person
is no worse than having more than
one person in love with you. How about
Reggie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Reggie? [<i>The sparrows'
chatter starts again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>nods</i>]. Reggie's in love with
you, isn't he? So am I. And both at
once too! I'm only in love with one person
at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>rebelliously</i>]. I can't help
Reggie being in love with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> And I can't help <i>my</i> being in
love with you. That's just my point. I
knew you'd see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I don't see it at all. Reggie
is quite different from you. Reggie's
love is true and constant....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Well, I'm a <i>constant</i> lover if
you come to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> You aren't. You know you
aren't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes, I am. A constant lover is
a lover who is constantly in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Only with the same person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> It doesn't say so. It only says
constant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>half-laughing</i>]. How ridiculous
you are! [<i>Turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>sigh of relief</i>]. That's right.
Now you're good-tempered again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I'm not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> What a story!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I'm not. I'm very, <i>very</i>
angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> That's impossible. You can't
possibly be angry and laugh at the same
time, can you? No one can. And you
<i>did</i> laugh. You're doing it now.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She does so unwillingly.</i>]</p>

<p>So don't let's quarrel any more. It's absurd
to quarrel on such a fine day, isn't
it? Let's make it up, and be lovers again.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The sparrows die away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Well, you're very foolish.
Love isn't a thing to throw away. It's
too precious for that. Love is the most
beautiful thing in the whole world. You
said so yourself not ten minutes ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I didn't. You said it.
[<i>Looking down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> But you said it after me.
[<i>Gently and gravely.</i>] Eve, dear, don't
be silly. Let's be in love while we can.
Youth is the time to be in love, isn't it?
Soon you and I will be dull and stupid
and middle-aged like all the other tedious
people. And then it will be too late.
Youth passes so quickly. Don't let's
waste a second of it. They say the May-fly
only lives for one day. He is born
in the morning. All the afternoon he
flutters over the river in the sunshine,
dodging the trout and flirting with other
May-flies. And at evening he dies.
Think of the poor May-fly who happens
to be born on a wet day! The tragedy
of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>softly</i>]. Poor May-fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> There! You're sorry for the
May-fly, you see. You're only angry
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Because you're not a May-fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Yes, I am. A sort of May-fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>with suspicion of tears in her
voice</i>]. You aren't. How can you be?
Besides, you said you were a cuckoo just
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> I suppose I'm a cuckoo-May-fly.
For I <i>hate</i> wet days. And if you're
going to cry again, it might just as well
be wet, mightn't it? So do dry your eyes
like a good girl. Let me do it for you.
[<i>Does it with her handkerchief.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She laughs ruefully.</i>]</p>

<p>There, that's better. And now we're going
to be good children again, aren't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>holding out hand</i>]. And you'll
kiss and be friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> I'll be friends, of course.
[<i>Sadly.</i>] But you must never kiss me
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> What a shame! Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>. Because you mustn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Well, you'll sit
down again anyhow, won't you? just to
show we've made it up. [<i>Moves towards
tree.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>shakes head</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>disappointed; turns</i>]. A....
Then you haven't really made it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Yes, I have. [<i>Picks up her
hat.</i>] But I must go now. Reggie's
coming down by the five o'clock train,
and I want to be at the station to meet
him. [<i>Holds out hand.</i>] Good-by, Mr.
Harburton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>taking hand</i>]. Eve! You're
going to accept Reggie! [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> [<i>half to herself</i>]. I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> And he'll have to tell your
mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil</span> [<i>drops her hand</i>]. Poor Reggie!
So <i>his</i> romance ends too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> It won't! If I marry Reggie
I shall make him very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cecil.</span> Very likely. Marriage may be
happiness, but I'm hanged if it's romance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span> Oh! [<i>Exclamation of impatience.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She turns away and exits <span class="smcap">R.</span></i>]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Time:</span> <i>The Fifteenth Century</i>.]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Place:</span> <i>A Monastery on one of the
foothills of Himalaya</i>.]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap"><ins class="correction" title="original reads 'Sene'">Scene</ins>:</span> <i>In the foreground is the outer
court of a Monastery. In the center of
the court is a sacred plant, growing out
of a small altar of earth about two feet
square. On the left of the court is a
sheer precipice, adown which a flight of
stone steps&mdash;only a few of which are
visible&mdash;connects the Monastery with the
village in the valley below</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the right are the temple and the
adobe walls and the roof of the monastery
cells. There is a little space between
the temple and the adobe walls, which is
the passage leading to the inner recesses
of the monastery. Several steps lead to
the doors of the temple, which give on the
court. In the distance, rear, are the
snowy peaks of the Himalayas, glowing
under the emerald sky of an Indian afternoon.
To the left, the distances stretch
into vast spaces of wooded hills. Long
bars of light glimmer and die as the vast
clouds, with edges of crimson, golden and
silver, spread portentously over the hills
and forest.</i></p>

<p><i>A roll of thunder in the distance, accompanies
the rise of the curtain.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> [<i>He is reading a palm-leaf
manuscript near the Sacred Plant. He
looks up at the sky.</i>] It forbodes a calamity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> He will be here presently.
Listen, master: it sayeth: "Only a hair's
breadth divides the true from the false.
Upon him who by thought, word or deed
confuses the two, will descend the Judgment
of Indra."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> The thunder of Indra is
just. It will strike the erring and the
unrighteous no matter where they hide
themselves; in the heart of the forest or
in the silence of the cloisters, Indra's
Judgment will descend on them. Even
the erring heart that knows not that it is
erring will be smitten and chastised by
Indra. [<i>Thunder rumbles in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Master, when you speak, you
not only fill the heart with ecstasy, but
also the soul with the beauty of truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> To praise is good. But why
praise me, who have yet to find God
and,&mdash;[<i>Shakes his head sadly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> You will find Him soon;
your time is nigh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I wish it were true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Master, if there be anything
that I can do for you. If I could only
lighten your burden a little,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Thou hast done that already.
All the cares of the monastery thou hast
taken from me. Thou hast bound me to
thee by bonds of gratitude that can never
break. [<i>Enter Kanada.</i>] Ah, Kanada,
how be it with you to-day? [<i>Coming to
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> [<i>He is a lad of twenty and
two.</i>] By your blessing I am well and
at peace. Have you finished your meditation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> [<i>Sadly.</i>] Nine hours have I
meditated, but&mdash;I shall say the prayers
now. [<i>Enters the temple and shuts the
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> He seems not to be himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> When he is in meditation for
a long time, he becomes another being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> There is sadness in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> How can he be sad,&mdash;he who
has risen above joy and sorrow, pleasure
and pain, hate and love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Above love, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Yea, hate and love being opposite,
are Maya, illusion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Yet we must love the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Yea, that we do to help the
world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> The Master is tender to the
villagers even if they lead the worldly
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> We be monks. We have
broken all the ties of the world, even
those of family, so that we can bestow
our thoughts, care and love upon all the
children of God. Our love is impartial.
[<i>The thunder growls in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Yea, that is the truth. Yet
I think the Master loves thee more than
any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Nay, brother. He loves no
one more than another. I have been with
him ten years; that makes him depend
on me. But if the truth were known,&mdash;he
loves none. For he loves all. Indra,
be my witness: the Master loveth no one
more than another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Ah, noble-souled Master!
Yet I feel happy to think that he loveth
thee more than any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> He loves each living creature.
He is not as the worldly ones who
love by comparison&mdash;this one more, the
other less. Last night, as the rain wailed
without like a heart-broken woman, how
his voice rose in song of light and love!
He is one of God's prophets, and a true
singer of His praise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> I can hear him yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> I will never forget the ineffable
joy that glowed in his words.
Only he who has renounced all ties, can
speak with such deep and undying love.
No anxiety&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> It was that of which I would
speak to thee. Dost thou not see sadness
and anxiety in the Master's face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> He is deep in thought&mdash;naught
else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Ever since that message was
brought him the other day, he has seemed
heavy hearted. It was melancholy tidings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Nay, that message had
naught to do with him. [<i>Thunder
growls. The Temple doors open. Shukra
comes out of the Temple and shuts
the doors behind him. Then he stands
still in front of the Temple.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> [<i>Calling.</i>] Kanada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Yea, Master. [<i>He goes up
to Shukra, who gives him some directions.
Kanada exits; Shukra stands looking at
the sky.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> How wonderful a vision he
is! As he stands at the threshold of the
temple he seems like a new God, another
divinity come down to earth to lead the
righteous on to the realms celestial. Ah,
Master, how grateful am I to have thee
as my teacher! I thank Brahma for giving
thee to me.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Kanada. Shukra then walks
to Shanta, with Kanada following
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Master, all is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Go ye to the village; ask
them if all be well with them. When the
heavens are unkind&mdash;ah, if it rains another
day all the crops will be destroyed.
What will they live on? No, no, it cannot
be. Go ye both down to them and
take them my blessings: Tell them we
will make another offering to Indra to-night.
It must not rain any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> Bring out begging bowls,
Kanada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Shall I bring the torches,
too? [<i>Crossing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> The clouds may hide the
moon; yea, the torches, too. [<i>Kanada
exits <span class="smcap">R.</span></i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Yea. [<i>Thunder growls
above head.</i>] The storm grows apace.
I hope thou wilt find shelter ere it breaks.
[<i>A short silence.</i>] The world is growing
darker and darker each day. Sin and
Vice are gathering around it like a vast
coiling Serpent. We monks be the only
ones that can save it and set it free.
Shanta, be steadfast; strengthen me.
Help me to bring the light to the world.
Thou art not only my disciple, but my
friend and brother. [<i>He embraces Shanta.</i>]
Save me from the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> [<i>Entering.</i>] Here be&mdash;[<i>Stops
in surprise.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> [<i>Releasing Shanta.</i>] Come
to me, Kanada. [<i>The latter does so,
Shukra putting an arm around Kanada's
neck.</i>] Little Brother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> [<i>Radiantly.</i>] Master&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Be brave and free&mdash;free
from the delusions of this world, Sansara.
Go yet to the village; take them
our blessings! Hari be with them all!
May ye return hither safely. [<i>Thunder
and lightning.</i>] Ah, Lord Indra!&mdash;Look,
it is raining yonder. Go, hasten&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shanta.</span> [<i>Taking a begging bowl and
torch from Kanada.</i>] Come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> [<i>Putting his hands on their
heads.</i>] I bless ye both. May Indra
protect ye&mdash;[<i>the rest of his words are
drowned by the lightning flash and peal
of thunder</i>].</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The two disciples intone:</i> "OM
Shanti OM." <i>They go down the
steps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> May this storm pass. OM
Shiva. Shiva love you, my Shanta.
For ten long years he has been with me;
he has greatly helped me in my search
after Him who is the only living Reality.
To-day I am nearer God&mdash;I stand at
the threshold of realization. I seem to
feel that it will not be long before the
Veil will be lifted and I shall press my
heart against the heart of the ultimate
mystery&mdash;Who comes there? [<i>Listens
attentively</i>]. They cannot have gone and
come back so soon. Ha! another illusion!
These days I am beset by endless
illusions. Perhaps that betokens the end
of my search, as the gloom is always
thickest ere the dawn. Yea, after this
will come the Light; I will see God!
[<i>Hears a noise; listens attentively.</i>] Are
they already returning? [<i>Calling.</i>]
Shanta! [<i>He crosses and looks down.
Thunder rolls very loudly now. He does
not heed that. Suddenly he recoils in
agitation. Footsteps are heard from below,
rising higher and higher. Shukra
rubs his eyes to make sure that he has
really seen something that is not an illusion.
He goes forward a few steps.
The head of an old man rises into view,
Shukra is stupefied; walks backwards until
his back touches the Sacred plant.
He stands still. The old man at last
climbs the last step. He has not noticed
Shukra. He looks at the Himalayas
in the rear. Then his eyes travel
over the monastery walls&mdash;Now suddenly
they catch sight of Shukra.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> What seek ye here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>eyeing him carefully</i>].
Ah, Shukra! dost thou not recognize
thine aged father? [<i>He goes to Shukra
with outstretched arms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I have no father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> But I am thy father. Did
not my messenger come the other day?
[<i>Silence.</i>] Did he lie to me? Dost thou
not know thy mother is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Thy messenger came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Then come thou home at
once. There is not time to be lost.
Come, my son, ere thy mother leaves this
earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I cannot go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Thou canst not go? Dost
thou not know that thy mother is on her
death-bed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I have renounced the world.
For twelve years I have had no father,
nor mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Thou didst leave us, but
we did not renounce thee. And now
thou shouldst come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I told thy messenger that I
have no father nor mother,&mdash;I cannot
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> I heard it all. If you art
born of us, thou canst not have a heart
of stone? Come, my son: I, thy father,
implore thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Nay, nay; God alone is my
father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Hath it not been said in
the scriptures that thy parents are thy
God? Thy father should be obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> That was said by one who
had not seen the Truth, the Light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> I command thee in the
name of the Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> God alone can command me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Vishnu protect me! Art
thou dreaming, my child? Yonder lies
thy mother, fighting death,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I have heard it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> And yet thou wilt not go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Nay, father, I cannot go.
The day I took the vow of a monk, that
day I cut the bond that binds me to
you all. I must be free of all ties. I
must love none for myself that I may
love all for God. Here I must remain
where God has placed me, until He calls
me elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> But thy mother lies, fighting
with each breath. She wishes to see
thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I cannot come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> But thou must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> I would if I could; but my
life is in the hands of God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>mocking</i>]. God! Thy
life belongs to God? Who gave thee
life? Not God, but she who lies there
dying; what ingratitude! This, indeed, is
the age of darkness; sons are turning
against their fathers,&mdash;and killing their
own mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. I may not love one
more than another; my steps, as my
heart, go whither God guides them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>mocking</i>]. Truth is thy
witness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> May Indra himself punish
me if I love one more than another.
Hear me, Indra. [<i>The roll of thunder
above.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>in desperation</i>]. Come,
my son, in the name of thine own God I
pray to thee, come to thy mother. I
kneel at thy feet and beg for this boon.
[<i>He does so.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>raising him to his feet. He
puts his own head down on the old man's
feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Then thou comest? [<i>Shukra
rises to his feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. There is a
law in the Sacred books that says an ascetic
should see the place of his birth
every twelfth year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> And it is twelve years now
since thou didst renounce us! Ah!
blessed be the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Yet, father, if I go, I go
not in obedience to the law, but since the
desire to see my mother is uppermost in
me, I who dreamt not of the law hitherto&mdash;yea,
now I hasten to abide by the law.
Ah, what mockery! It is not the letter
of the law, but the spirit in us that
judges us sinners or saints. Now if I
go with thee to obey the law, that would
be betraying the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Betraying the law!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Thought alone is the measure
of our innocence. He who thinks
evil is a doer of evil indeed. Nay, nay,
tempt me not with the law. I must remain
here. I must keep my vow. [<i>He
looks up to heaven; it is covered with
enormous black clouds.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> The law is not written in
the heavens. It is inscribed in the heart
of man. Obey the dictates of thy heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> God alone shall be obeyed.
I cannot betray His command. I, who
am an ascetic, must not yield to the desire
to see my mother&mdash;Nay! God&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> What manner of God is
He that deprives a dying mother of her
son? Such a God never was known in
Hindu life. No such God lives, nor
breathes. [<i>Thunder and lightning.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Erring Soul, do not blaspheme
your creator. He is the God of
Truth&mdash;God of Love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>disdainfully</i>]. God of
Love,&mdash; How can He be God of Love
if He dries up the stream of thy heart
and blinds thy reason as the clouds blind
the eyes of the Sun? Nay, thou liest.
It is not the God of Love, but the God
of thine insane self&mdash;self-love that makes
thee rob thy mother of her only joy in
life. I&mdash;yea, I will answer to God for
thee. If, by coming to see thy mother,
thou sinnest, I ask God to make me pay
for thy sin. Come, obey thy father,&mdash;I
will take the burden of thy sin, if sin
it be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Nay, each man pays for his
sins as each man reaps the harvest of his
own good deeds. None can atone for
another. Ah, God! cursed be the hour
when I was born. Cursed,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Thou cursest
thy birth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Yea, to be born in this
world of woe is a curse indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Then curse thy tormented
mind and thy desolate heart; curse not,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Nay, I curse the hour that
saw me come to this earth of delusion and
Maya. I do curse,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Thou dost dare curse the
hour when thou wert born! Ah, vile sinner!
To curse the hour of thy birth
when thy mother is dying! God be my
witness, he has incurred his father's
wrath. Now,&mdash;no God can save thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Nay, nay,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Shukra. I, thy father, thy
God in life, curse thee. Thou hast deprived
thy mother of her child, and her
death of its solace. Thou hast incurred
the wrath of the Spirits of all thy departed
ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>cries out</i>]. Not thus; not
thus. [<i>Thunder and lightning, the whole
sky is swept by the clouds.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> Not thus? Thus alone
shall it be. Cursed be thou at night;
cursed be thou by day; cursed be thou
going; cursed be thou coming. Thou art
cursed by the spirit of the race, by the
spirit of God. [<i>Continued thunder and
lightning.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>falling at his father's feet</i>].
I beseech thee, my father,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>shrinking away</i>]. Touch
me not. [<i>Going left.</i>] Cursed art thou
in Life and Death forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> God!&mdash;Father, go not thus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man.</span> I am not thy father.
[<i>Deafening and blinding thunder and
lightning.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span> [<i>going down the steps</i>].
Pollute not my hearing by calling me thy
father. May the judgment of Indra be
upon thee! [<i>He totters down out of
sight, left, in anger and horror.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Father, hear, oh hear!
[<i>The rain comes down in a deluge; thunder
and lightning. The rain blots everything
out of sight. It pours in deep,
dark sheets, through which the chains
and sheets of lightning burn and run.
After raining awhile, the sky clears. In
the pale moonlight, Shukra is seen
crouching near the Sacred plant. He is
wet and disheveled. He slowly rises,
swaying in exhaustion. Voices are heard
below.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Can it be that it is over?
Has Indra judged me and found me free
of error? Yea, were I in error, the lightning
would have struck me. I lay there
blinded by rain awaiting my death. It
did not come. Yea, Indra has judged!
[<i>Noises below; he does not hear.</i>] O,
thou shadowy world, I am free of thee at
last. Free of love and loving, free of all
bondage. I have no earthly ties,&mdash;I lean
on God alone. At last, I am bound to
no earthly being, not even&mdash;[<i>strange
pause</i>]&mdash;not even,&mdash;Shanta. [<i>He becomes
conscious of the noise of approaching
footsteps and the light of the torches
from below.</i>] Who is that? [<i>He goes
forward a few steps. Enter Kanada,
torch in hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Master, Master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra.</span> Kanada, thou,&mdash;[<i>a pause,
very brief but poignant</i>]. Why this agitation?
Shanta, where is Shanta?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> Shanta is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>seeing the other torches
rising suddenly</i>]. Speak! Who comes
hither?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada.</span> They bring a dead man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span>. Who is he? [<i>As a premonition
of the truth comes over him.</i>]
Where is Shanta?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kanada</span> [<i>blurts out</i>]. At the foot
of the hill the lightning struck him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shukra</span> [<i>with a terrible cry</i>]. Shanta,&mdash;my
Shanta! [<i>Two men carrying
torches with one hand, and dragging
something white with the other, come up
the steps. This vision silences Shukra.
A pause follows. Another torch is seen
rising behind them.</i>]</p>

[<i>Pause again, looking into the starry
heavens.</i>] This is the Judgment of Indra!</p>

<h2>THE WORKHOUSE WARD</h2>

<p class="alignleft">A Play</p>
<p class="alignright">By Lady Gregory</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A ward in Cloon Workhouse.
The two old men in their beds</i>.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Isn't it a hard case,
Mike McInerney, myself and yourself to
be left here in the bed, and it the feast
day of Saint Colman, and the rest of the
ward attending on the Mass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Is it sitting up by
the hearth you are wishful to be, Michael
Miskell, with cold in the shoulders and
with speckled shins? Let you rise up so,
and you well able to do it, not like myself
that has pains the same as tin-tacks
within in my inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> If you have pains
within in your inside there is no one can
see it or know of it the way they can see
my own knees that are swelled up with
the rheumatism, and my hands that are
twisted in ridges the same as an old cabbage
stalk. It is easy to be talking about
soreness and about pains, and they maybe
not to be in it at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> To open me and to
analyze me you would know what sort
of a pain and a soreness I have in my
heart and in my chest. But I'm not one
like yourself to be cursing and praying
and tormenting the time the nuns are at
hand, thinking to get a bigger share than
myself of the nourishment and of the
milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> That's the way you
do be picking at me and faulting me. I
had a share and a good share in my early
time, and it's well you know that, and
the both of us reared in Skehanagh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> You may say that,
indeed, we are both of us reared in Skehanagh.
Little wonder you to have good
nourishment the time we were both rising,
and you bringing away my rabbits out
of the snare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> And you didn't
bring away my own eels, I suppose, I was
after spearing in the Turlough? Selling
them to the nuns in the convent you did,
and letting on they to be your own. For
you were always a cheater and a schemer,
grabbing every earthly thing for your
own profit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> And you were no
grabber yourself, I suppose, till your land
and all you had grabbed wore away from
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> If I lost it itself, it
was through the crosses I met with and
I going through the world. I never was
a rambler and a card-player like yourself,
Mike McInerney, that ran through
all and lavished it unknown to your
mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Lavished it, is it?
And if I did was it you yourself led me
to lavish it or some other one? It is on
my own floor I would be to-day and in
the face of my family, but for the misfortune
I had to be put with a bad next
door neighbor that was yourself. What
way did my means go from me is it?
Spending on fencing, spending on walls,
making up gates, putting up doors, that
would keep your hens and your ducks
from coming in through starvation on
my floor, and every four footed beast
you had from preying and trespassing on
my oats and my mangolds and my little
lock of hay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> O to listen to you!
And I striving to please you and to be
kind to you and to close my ears to the
abuse you would be calling and letting
out of your mouth. To trespass on your
crops is it? It's little temptation there
was for my poor beasts to ask to cross
the mering. My God Almighty! What
had you but a little corner of a field!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> And what do you
say to my garden that your two pigs had
destroyed on me the year of the big
tree being knocked, and they making
gaps in the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Ah, there does be
a great deal of gaps knocked in a twelve-month.
Why wouldn't they be knocked
by the thunder, the same as the tree, or
some storm that came up from the west?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> It was the west
wind, I suppose, that devoured my green
cabbage? And that rooted up my Champion
potatoes? And that ate the gooseberries
themselves from off the bush?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> What are you saying?
The two quietest pigs ever I had,
no way wicked and well ringed. They
were not ten minutes in it. It would be
hard for them to eat strawberries in that
time, let alone gooseberries that's full of
thorns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> They were not
quiet, but very ravenous pigs you had
that time, as active as a fox they were,
killing my young ducks. Once they had
blood tasted you couldn't stop them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> And what happened
myself the fair day of Esserkelly,
the time I was passing your door? Two
brazened dogs that rushed out and took
a piece of me. I never was the better
of it or of the start I got, but wasting
from then till now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Thinking you were
a wild beast they did, that had made his
escape out of the traveling show, with
the red eyes of you and the ugly face
of you, and the two crooked legs of you
that wouldn't hardly stop a pig in a
gap. Sure any dog that had any life in
it at all would be roused and stirred seeing
the like of you going the road!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> I did well taking
out a summons against you that time.
It is a great wonder you not to have
been bound over through your lifetime,
but the laws of England is queer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> What ailed me
that I did not summons yourself after
you stealing away the clutch of eggs I
had in the barrel, and I away in Ardrahan
searching out a clocking hen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> To steal your eggs
is it? Is that what you are saying now?
[<i>Holds up his hands.</i>] The Lord is in
heaven, and Peter and the saints, and
yourself that was in Ardrahan that day
put a hand on them as soon as myself!
Isn't it a bad story for me to be wearing
out my days beside you the same as a
spancelled goat. Chained I am and
tethered I am to a man that is ram-shacking
his mind for lies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> If it is a bad story
for you, Michael Miskell, it is a worse
story again for myself. A Miskell to be
next and near me through the whole of
the four quarters of the year. I never
heard there to be any great name on the
Miskells as there was on my own race
and name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> You didn't, is it?
Well, you could hear it if you had but
ears to hear it. Go across to Lisheen
Crannagh and down to the sea and to
Newtown Lynch and the mills of Duras
and you'll find a Miskell, and as far as
Dublin!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> What signifies
Crannagh and the mills of Duras? Look
at all my own generations that are buried
at the Seven Churches. And how many
generations of the Miskells are buried in
it? Answer me that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> I tell you but for
the wheat that was to be sowed there
would be more side cars and more common
cars at my father's funeral (God
rest his soul!) than at any funeral ever
left your own door. And as to my
mother, she was a Cuffe from Claregalway,
and it's she had the purer blood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> And what do you
say to the banshee? Isn't she apt to have
knowledge of the ancient race? Was
ever she heard to screech or to cry for
the Miskells? Or for the Cuffes from
Claregalway? She was not, but for the
six families, the Hyneses, the Foxes, the
Faheys, the Dooleys, the McInerneys. It
is of the nature of the McInerneys she is
I am thinking, crying them the same as
a king's children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> It is a pity the
banshee not to be crying for yourself at
this minute, and giving you a warning to
quit your lies and your chat and your
arguing and your contrary ways; for
there is no one under the rising sun
could stand you. I tell you you are not
behaving as in the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Is it wishful for
my death you are? Let it come and meet
me now and welcome so long as it will
part me from yourself! And I say, and
I would kiss the book on it, I to have one
request only to be granted, and I leaving
it in my will, it is what I would request,
nine furrows of the field, nine ridges of
the hills, nine waves of the ocean to be
put between your grave and my own
grave the time we will be laid in the
ground!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Amen to that!
Nine ridges, is it? No, but let the whole
ridge of the world separate us till the
Day of Judgment! I would not be laid
anear you at the Seven Churches, I to
get Ireland without a divide!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> And after that
again! I'd sooner than ten pound in my
hand, I to know that my shadow and my
ghost will not be knocking about with
your shadow and your ghost, and the
both of us waiting our time. I'd sooner
be delayed in Purgatory! Now, have
you anything to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> I have everything
to say, if I had but the time to say it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> [<i>Sitting up.</i>] Let
me up out of this till I'll choke you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> You scolding pauper
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> [<i>Shaking his fist
at him.</i>] Wait a while!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> [<i>Shaking his fist.</i>]
Wait a while yourself!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Donohoe comes in with a parcel.
She is a countrywoman with
a frilled cap and a shawl. She
stands still a minute. The two old
men lie down and compose themselves.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> They bade me come
up here by the stair. I never was in this
place at all. I don't know am I right.
Which now of the two of ye is Mike McInerney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Who is it is calling
me by my name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Sure amn't I your sister,
Honor McInerney that was, that is
now Honor Donohoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> So you are, I believe.
I didn't know you till you pushed
anear me. It is time indeed for you to
come see me, and I in this place five
year or more. Thinking me to be no
credit to you, I suppose, among that tribe
of the Donohoes. I wonder they to give
you leave to come ask am I living yet or
dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Ah, sure, I buried the
whole string of them. Himself was the
last to go. [<i>Wipes her eyes.</i>] The Lord
be praised he got a fine natural death.
Sure we must go through our crosses.
And he got a lovely funeral; it would
delight you to hear the priest reading
the Mass. My poor John Donohoe! A
nice clean man, you couldn't but be fond
of him. Very severe on the tobacco he
was, but he wouldn't touch the drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> And is it in Curranroe
you are living yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> It is so. He left all
to myself. But it is a lonesome thing the
head of a house to have died!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> I hope that he has
left you a nice way of living?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Fair enough, fair
enough. A wide lovely house I have; a
few acres of grass land ... the grass
does be very sweet that grows among the
stones. And as to the sea, there is something
from it every day of the year, a
handful of periwinkles to make kitchen,
or cockles maybe. There is many a thing
in the sea is not decent, but cockles is fit
to put before the Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> You have all that!
And you without e'er a man in the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> It is what I am thinking,
yourself might come and keep me
company. It is no credit to me a brother
of my own to be in this place at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> I'll go with you!
Let me out of this! It is the name of
the McInerneys will be rising on every
side!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> I don't know. I was
ignorant of you being kept to the bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> I am not kept to
it, but maybe an odd time when there is
a colic rises up within me. My stomach
always gets better the time there is a
change in the moon. I'd like well to draw
anear you. My heavy blessing on you,
Honor Donohoe, for the hand you have
held out to me this day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Sure you could be
keeping the fire in, and stirring the pot
with the bit of Indian meal for the hens,
and milking the goat and taking the tacklings
off the donkey at the door; and
maybe putting out the cabbage plants in
their time. For when the old man died
the garden died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> I could to be sure,
and be cutting the potatoes for seed.
What luck could there be in a place and
a man not to be in it? Is that now a suit
of clothes you have brought with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> It is so, the way you
will be tasty coming in among the neighbors
at Curranroe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> My joy you are!
It is well you earned me! Let me up
out of this! [<i>He sits up and spreads out
the clothes and tries on coat.</i>] That now
is a good frieze coat ... and a hat in
the fashion.... [<i>He puts on hat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. And is
it going out of this you are, Mike McInerney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Don't you hear I
am going? To Curranroe I am going.
Going I am to a place where I will get
every good thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> And is it to leave
me here after you you will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney</span> [<i>in a rising chant</i>].
Every good thing! The goat and the kid
are there, the sheep and the lamb are
there, the cow does be running and she
coming to be milked! Plowing and
seed sowing, blossom at Christmas time,
the cuckoo speaking through the dark
days of the year! Ah, what are you talking
about? Wheat high in hedges, no talk
about the rent! Salmon in the rivers as
plenty as hurf! Spending and getting
and nothing scarce! Sport and pleasure,
and music on the strings! Age will go
from me and I will be young again.
Geese and turkeys for the hundreds and
drink for the whole world!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Ah, Mike, is it
truth you are saying, you to go from me
and to leave me with rude people and
with townspeople, and with people of
every parish in the union, and they having
no respect for me or no wish for me at
all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Whist now and I'll
leave you ... my pipe [<i>hands it over</i>];
and I'll engage it is Honor Donohoe won't
refuse to be sending you a few ounces of
tobacco an odd time, and neighbors coming
to the fair in November or in the
month of May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Ah, what signifies
tobacco? All that I am craving is the
talk. There to be no one at all to say
out to whatever thought might be rising
in my innate mind! To be lying here and
no conversible person in it would be the
abomination of misery!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Look now, Honor....
It is what I often heard said, two
to be better than one.... Sure if you
had an old trouser was full of holes
... or a skirt ... wouldn't you put another
in under it that might be as tattered
as itself, and the two of them together
would make some sort of a decent show?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Ah, what are you saying?
There is no holes in that suit I
brought you now, but as sound it is as
the day I spun it for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> It is what I am
thinking, Honor.... I do be weak an
odd time.... Any load I would carry, it
preys upon my side ... and this man
does be weak an odd time with the swelling
in his knees ... but the two of us
together it's not likely it is at the one time
we would fail. Bring the both of us with
you, Honor, and the height of the castle
of luck on you, and the both of us together
will make one good hardy man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> I'd like my job! Is it
queer in the head you are grown asking
me to bring in a stranger off the road?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> I am not, ma'am,
but an old neighbor I am. If I had forecasted
this asking I would have asked it
myself. Michael Miskell I am, that was
in the next house to you in Skehanagh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> For pity's sake!
Michael Miskell is it? That's worse
again. Yourself and Mike that never left
fighting and scolding and attacking one
another! Sparring at one another like
two young pups you were, and threatening
one another after like two grown
dogs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> All the quarreling
was ever in the place it was myself did
it. Sure his anger rises fast and goes
away like the wind. Bring him out with
myself now, Honor Donohoe, and God
bless you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Well, then, I will not
bring him out, and I will not bring yourself
out, and you not to learn better sense.
Are you making yourself ready to come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> I am thinking,
maybe ... it is a mean thing for a man
that is shivering into seventy years to go
changing from place to place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Well, take your luck
or leave it. All I asked was to save you
from the hurt and the harm of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Bring the both of
us with you or I will not stir out of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> Give me back my fine
suit so [<i>begins gathering up the clothes</i>],
till I go look for a man of my own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Let you go so, as
you are so unnatural and so disobliging,
and look for some man of your own, God
help him! For I will not go with you at
all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Donohoe.</span> It is too much time I
lost with you, and dark night waiting to
overtake me on the road. Let the two
of you stop together, and the back of my
hand to you. It is I will leave you there
the same as God left the Jews!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes out. The old men lie down
and are silent for a moment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Maybe the house
is not so wide as what she says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Why wouldn't it be
wide?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Ah, there does be
a good deal of middling poor houses down
by the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> What would you
know about wide houses? Whatever sort
of a house you had yourself it was too
wide for the provision you had into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Whatever provision
I had in my house it was wholesome
provision and natural provision. Herself
and her periwinkles! Periwinkles is a
hungry sort of food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Stop your impudence
and your chat or it will be the worse
for you. I'd bear with my own father
and mother as long as any man would,
but if they'd vex me I would give them
the length of a rope as soon as another!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> I would never ask
at all to go eating periwinkles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney</span> [<i>sitting up</i>]. Have
you any one to fight me?</p>

insults on me so, and death picking
at you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Miskell.</span> Sure I am saying
nothing at all to displease you. It is why
I wouldn't go eating periwinkles, I'm in
dread I might swallow the pin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike McInerney.</span> Who in the world
wide is asking you to eat them? You're

<p class="alignleft">A Play</p>
<p class="alignright">By J. H. Speenhoff</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A large fashionably appointed
room with few decorations on the
walls. The latter are papered in yellow
with large black lilies. To the right, a
tall broad window with heavy brown curtains.
To the left, an old gold harp with
a little footstool. Behind, to the right,
a door with brown porti&egrave;res, affording a
view of a vestibule and banister. To the
left, down front, a broad couch with black
head cushions. Next to it the end of a
heavy broad oaken table, with the side
turned toward the couch. Behind, the
back wall has an open chimney with
carved wood and ornaments on it. Beside
the chimney, on both sides, are two
large comfortable chairs and two others
by the table and window respectively.
On the table are the remains of breakfast:
fruit glasses and two empty champagne
bottles</i>.</p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises Louise is discovered
lying on the couch with her feet extended
toward the audience. She lies
quietly and gazes blankly in the distance.
Closer scrutiny reveals that she is in the
last stage of intoxication. On the whole,
it is rather a lady-like inebriety and expresses
itself now and again by way of a
heavy sigh, looseness of limb, a languid
flutter of the eyelids and a disposition to
be humorous. It is about three in the
afternoon. As for the tone of the room,
there are a lot of yellows, blacks and
browns; the light is quite subdued. Soon
after the rise of the curtain, Louise begins
slowly and dreamily to hum a melody.
She stops for a while, gazes blankly
around and starts humming again. Then
she raises herself, crosses her arms on
the tables and rests her head on them.
Her hair is loosely arranged&mdash;or disarranged.
Her dressing gown is black
and white.</i></p>

<p><i>A bell is rung downstairs. Louise does
not seem to hear it. Another ting-a-ling.
You can hear the maid going downstairs.
The door opens and shuts. Two pairs of
feet are heard climbing the stairs. The
maid parts the porti&egrave;res, shows Van der
Elst in and points Louise out to him,
meanwhile remaining discreetly behind
the porti&egrave;res.</i></p>

<p><i>The truth is that Sophie is very much
embarrassed. She looks as if she has been
called away from her proper duties. She
is a healthy maid, with tousled blond hair,
cotton dress, blue apron, maid's cap and
is in her stocking feet. She goes toward
Louise, then stops confusedly at a little
distance from her. She moves a chair
needlessly, in timid embarrassment, and
wipes her lips with her apron.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Here's a gentleman to see you&mdash;to

Why, nothing. But there's a gentleman

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> A gentleman? Very well, you
may go. [<i>She closes her eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> But ... but ... he  wishes
to speak to you. A gray-haired gentleman.
He is standing by the porti&egrave;res

pause.</i>] May he...? [<i>Louise does not
answer. Sophie waits a bit, then she

won't answer, sir. Maybe you'd better
come back in an hour or so....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Hm! No. That's impossible.
[<i>Looks at Louise.</i>] What's the

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> No ... you see ... she is,

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes, from.... [<i>Hesitates.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Now that Sophie is out of the room,
one has an opportunity to scrutinize
Van Elst more closely. He is
a prosperous-looking country gentleman
about fifty years old. He
wears a shining tophat, white vest
with a gold chain across his stomach,
tight-fitting blue trousers, low
shoes, white socks and a short blue
coat. He is clean-shaven and
when he removes his hat, one observes
that his hair is close-cropped.
His walking-stick, contrary to expectations,
is light and slim. He
takes a chair near the window, directly
behind the harp, puts his
hat, cane and gloves beside him on
the floor and looks around. He
glances at Louise, shakes his head
solemnly, coughs, wipes his forehead,
puts his handkerchief carefully
away, coughs again, moves
his chair and after some signs of
nervousness, says</i>]:</p>

I put it? I've come to speak with you

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>very considerably embarrassed

We can talk this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>rising, disturbed</i>]. No.

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>pulling his chair closer</i>]. I
don't see why....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Don't you think I'm very beautiful
and wise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> I have very serious things
to discuss with you. Will you listen to
me? [<i>He assumes an important pose.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Why do you take on such a
severe tone? You must be more gentle&mdash;very
gentle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Hm! Very well. First
let me tell you who I am. My name is
Van der Elst. I'm the new attorney back
home, and I am a friend of your father's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> I think a lot of your father.
As you know, Mr. Degudo was your
father's lawyer; but he's gone away and
I've taken his place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Why am I honored with these
confidences?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> You ought to know who I
am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Well, what's your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. I told you that
my name is Van der Elst, attorney-at-law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>smiling vapidly</i>]. Have you
any bonbons with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> What sort of a question is
that, madam? You're not listening to
me. [<i>He gets up angrily, about to collect
his effects prior to leaving.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Are you leaving me so soon?
If I were you, I wouldn't leave.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Van Elst walks back and forth
in annoyance, muttering all the

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> What are you muttering
about? Come here and sit by my side.
Last week I received flowers from an old
gentleman, an old gentleman. At least
that is what the girl said. He sent them
for my shoulders, mind you. You see,
he had seen my shoulders. Please sit
down. That's why he sent me flowers&mdash;[<i>extending
her hand</i>] and this ring came
with them. Look! [<i>Van der Elst has
taken a seat. She thrusts her hand before
his face.</i>] It's the thin one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Madam, I didn't come for
this frivolity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> What would you give if you
could kiss me?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Van Elst coughs and fumbles with
his handkerchief.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Do you know what I suspect?
I suspect that you are the old gentleman
in question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>getting up in high dudgeon</i>].
Madam, I consider that accusation entirely
improper, in view of the fact that
I am a respectable married man. I want
you to know that I keep out of these
things. My reputation is above reproach.
Do you intend to listen to me or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Don't shout so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Do you talk this way always?
You amaze me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I suspect you are
the gentleman with the pretty touch about
my shoulders. Well, sit down. Is he
gone? Are you gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>stepping forwardly boldly</i>].
I am still here. This is positively the
last time I'll ask you to listen to me. I
assure you, my patience is nearly exhausted.
Your father and mother, your
family have asked me to bring the following
to your notice. Your present conduct
has caused a great scandal. You've left
your family for a man who is too far
above you socially ever to make you his
wife. Consequently, you have become his
mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> I'm not through yet. Your
father and mother have requested me to
ask you to come back home. They await
you with open arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Don't be silly. Sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Oh, it's useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>incoherently</i>]. Will you promise
to tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> I suppose I'll have to wait.
[<i>He sits down in utter despair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>goes up to him unsteadily,
groping for the arm of the chair. With a
laugh</i>]. Tell me, which one was it. This
shoulder or this one? Ah, aren't you
clever! You're the old gentleman, aren't
you, you old duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> A useless commission.
Poor parents!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> What's that? The joke's on
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Next she'll ask me to dance
with her, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Dance? No dancing. Don't
get up. You needn't get up. I don't
mean it ... really, I don't.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Louise sits in front of the harp and

she falls limply to the floor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Good God, what's this? It
wasn't my fault. I suppose I was cruel
to her. [<i>Walks excitedly back and forth.

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Look at your mistress. I
can't make out what's wrong with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Oh, that's nothing. It happens
every day. Just a fainting fit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> What a life! What a life!
Why don't you do something? She can't
be allowed to lie there that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Just a minute. [<i>She seizes
Louise by the waist and lifts her from
the floor. Van Elst assists her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Nothing to worry about [<i>arranging
Louise's clothes</i>]. Now you lie
here and you'll be quite all right in a
very short while. She gets that way quite
frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>sinks into a chair</i>]. This is
frightful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>confidentially</i>]. Madam drinks
heavily in the afternoons and in the evening,
too, when the master is here. Yes,
and then they sing together and madam
plays on that thing there. [<i>Points to the
harp.</i>] It's very nice sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Who is the master?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> I don't know, sir. But that's
what I've been told to call him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Are they happy together?
Or do they sometimes quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> I don't know. I don't think
so, for he's very good and likes her very
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Madam never weeps or is
sad? I ask these questions for madam's
sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Oh, yes, she weeps sometimes.
But it's mostly when she hasn't had a
drink and feels out of sorts. But it's
soon cured when I fetch the wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Then she occasionally
thinks of her home. That may help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> May I suggest something,
sir? [<i>She busies herself clearing off the
table.</i>] If I were you, I should go away
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Go away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> For madam can't bear men
folks around her when she sobers up.
If I were you, I'd go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> No, I'll stay. If she's
sober after a while, perhaps she'll be
able to talk to me coherently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> You must know best. But I
warn you, madam can't bear to have anybody
else with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> What! Do you think I
came for that purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Of course. You're not trying
to tell me that you came to read the
newspaper with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> You keep your mouth shut.
I've come to ask madam to return to her
parents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Oh, that's it, is it? You're
from the family. I see. Of course ...
but she won't go with you.</p>

William! He's bolting. Help! Help!
Oh, the brown mare! Look! [<i>Sighs.</i>]</p>

goes on like that a lot. She was in a

when the horse bolted. That's what she
always dreams about these days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Ah, wait. I left my earrings

you so. [<i>She sighs heavily. A ring is

Open the door for him. It's her father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema</span> [<i>seating himself beside

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> I came to find out whether
you are happy or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> I don't know. Happy ...

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Why strange? Are you
happier here than&mdash;with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>leaning forward on her hands</i>].
Than with you? [<i>Looking up.</i>] I prefer
to be here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Don't you miss us all, just
the least little bit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Sometimes, when I'm alone.
All the same, I'd rather be here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Aren't you deluding yourself?
Wasn't your life with us at home
better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Better? What do you mean,
better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> You know what I mean.
Don't you regret running off with ...
him ... and spreading sorrow in our
hearts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> I loved him. And then I
yearned for freedom, for the pleasures
of life and travel. At home everything
was so dull and monotonous. I couldn't
stand the smug people at home. Their
life is one round of lying and gossiping,
of scolding and backbiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> But what of this sort of
existence? You don't quite appreciate
the damage you have done. How you
have stained the fair reputation of your
parents. I wonder whether that has ever
occurred to you? You say that you do
not like the people who are our neighbors
back home, but it is these very people
who make and unmake reputations. We
must live with them. Can't you realize
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Father, I'm sorry, but I
couldn't go back to them. The commonplace
tattlers with their humdrum, uneventful
lives scarcely exist for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> They don't exist for you,
you say. But, remember, that they despise
you. They and their contempt do
not reach you, but they reach us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>almost inaudibly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> But your future? Have
you thought of that? What will it be?
Wretchedness and contempt. When I
came in and saw you stretched out in that
condition, I....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Father, I want to forget. I
don't want to think of the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> In order not to think of
the past, you resort to drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Sometimes it is hard to forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Tell me, Louise: does he
love you, and do you love him? And
even if this be true, will he continue to
love you always? Won't the time come
when he will grow indifferent to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. Never ... never.
Not he. You don't believe that such a
thing is impossible? He cannot forget
me. I have given him everything ...
my love, myself ... all that is truly myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Aren't you a little too optimistic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Not when it concerns him.
He knows what I have sacrificed. He
knows what I have given him. There is
no room for doubt, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Very well, we will not
speak of it again. But how about us,
Louise? Don't you ever think of us?
Don't you ever long to come back to us, to
the old home where you were born?
Wouldn't you like to see it again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema</span> [<i>anxious and excited</i>]. Then
come back with me. Come back to us.
You know my motive for coming. Won't
you come back home with me? Everything
is in perfect readiness for you:
your little room, the flowers, the trees
... everything. Louise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Father, that can never be.
Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Why not? We have arranged
everything. Nothing will be lacking
for your welcome, your comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Why should I bring misfortune
to you? It would simply add to
your unhappiness. Isn't it better now
that I am away from home? Later on,
perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Later on? Did it ever occur
to you that there may be no later on?
You may not find us then. We are getting
old, your mother and I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Don't, please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Come, Louise. Come.
Think of the happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> How about the townfolks?
Would they accept me again, do you
think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Don't think of them.
Those who are sincerely friendly to us,
will continue to be so. The rest don't
count. Ah, if we only could have you
back, my child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Father, I cannot
go back. Don't you see that it is
utterly impossible? I am changed now.
And then I am not strong enough. Life
is so long and I cannot bear to face it
alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> But you will have us.
You belong to us, and your place, if you
have a place in the world, is with your
mother and father. Your old home is
waiting for you with welcoming arms.
Summer is coming and you know how
splendid the garden and the orchard are
when the lilac trees are in bloom. Do you
remember the little tree you planted once?
Doesn't your heart yearn to see the
little flowers that have sprouted on its
branches? Everything is just waiting
for you to come home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>dreamily</i>]. Everything....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> You will come, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> I cannot. I simply cannot.
It is your happiness that I am thinking
of. The intrusion of my life would spoil
everything. Everybody will blame you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> My child, I have long ago
put behind me what the world says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. And William?
What about William? What about him
when I go back? No, I can't do it. I
cannot leave him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> What about your mother,
Louise? She is waiting for you. She
will be at the window to-night, waiting
and peering out. Your chair is ready for
you and she herself will open the door to
greet you, to take you to her heart again.
Do you know, Louise, she has been getting
very gray of late. Come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Mother isn't ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Your mother wants to see
you before she....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>rising to her feet</i>]. I ... I
will do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Thank you, my child. [<i>He
embraces her</i>]. We shall go at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Ring for Sophie, please. Yes,
we will go at once. [<i>Close to him.</i>]
Mother is not seriously ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> I am sure, your return
will be her cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst</span> [<i>who has listened attentively
throughout the whole conversation</i>].
Madam, permit me also to thank you for
this resolve to return home. You are
going to make many hearts joyful because
of your decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>enters</i>]. Is there anything
you wish, madam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Pack my traveling bag. Get
my black hat and gray coat. I am leaving
at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Very well, madam, but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Lose no time about it. I'm in
a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> A lady called to see, madam,
and I told her you were engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> What did she want? Did she
say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> She said she would come back.
She insisted on speaking with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Do you know the lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes ... no. That is, I don't
know. I believe I've seen her before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Didn't she say what her errand
was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> No, madam, but she said she
would come back soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> When she comes, show her into
the drawing room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Have everything ready at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes, madam. [<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> You will excuse me. I must
change my clothes. I shall put my old
ones on. You see, I kept them. Then I
must write to him. I must tell him why
I am going away. [<i>She goes out by the
side door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> I feel as if I have never
been as happy as this before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> It will help your wife to
get well. She hasn't been very well these
last few weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Yes, I know it will do her
heaps of good. I am quite happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Don't excite your wife unnecessarily
to-night. Any shock may be
too much for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Yes, we will postpone our
rejoicing until to-morrow. You must
come to-morrow, but alone. Bring your
wife Sunday evening. The process of acclamation
will be slow, of course. There
is a train about six, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> Yes, at five forty-five. We
have an hour yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> The sooner the better. She
must have a change at first. I thought it
mightn't be a bad idea if we paid my
brother a visit at Frezier. It might do
her a lot of good. Yes, I think what
she needs is a change of scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> If I were you I would stay
home the first week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> We'll attend to that later.
It is terrible when you think of the condition
she was in when we arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> The maid said that it happened
quite often, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> What do you think he will
do when he learns that she is gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Elst.</span> If he is anything of a man,
if he is a man of honor, then he will stay
away. If not, there is the law. But I
believe it can be arranged although she
loves him very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Let's not speak of it any
more. She will change slowly, and so the
past will be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>enters with a traveling bag</i>].
Oh, isn't Madam here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> She will be back very
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Here's the bag. Everything
is ready. [<i>Puts Louise's things on the
table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>enters very simply dressed with
a letter in her hand</i>]. Here I am. [<i>To
Sophie.</i>] Have you packed everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes, everything is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Help me then.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Sophie helps Louise with her coat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Mail this letter for me. [<i>The
bell rings downstairs.</i>] Go and see who
it is. I am not at home to anybody
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> It may be the lady who was
here before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Heavens, I had almost forgotten
her. If it's the lady&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> See who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>going</i>]. Yes, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> What is it, Louise? What
does the lady wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Nothing, father [<i>with a forced
laugh</i>]. Nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Must you see her? Can't
you say that you are about to go away
on a trip and that you cannot see her?
Say that, and let us go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Oh, it's nothing. I will just
speak to her, and then we will go at
once. [<i>She laughs again in a forced
manner.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> But why are you so excited?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>entering</i>]. Madam, the lady
has gone away. She left this. [<i>She extends
a visiting card.</i>] But&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> What is it, Sophie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> She told me to tell you that
you must think of the bay mare. Here
is her card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Oh, a card [<i>tries
to restrain herself</i>]. Give it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> Then she said nothing about
Elsa and the race.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Louise takes the card and goes a
little to the side.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> What's the matter, Louise?
What ails you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>deeply affected</i>]. Father,
father! [<i>She looks from the card to her
father with tears in her eyes; then she
goes mutely toward the couch, sits down,
and stares blankly in front of her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>sobbing</i>]. I can't do it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema</span> [<i>takes the visiting card from
her hands</i>]. Must you pay all that?
Have you lost all that money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Through gambling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Good God! Gambling,
too? And to-night you must pay all that
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie</span> [<i>entering excitedly with a
small bunch of flowers</i>]. Madam,
Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>looks up slowly and sees the
flowers</i>]. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> These are the compliments of
Mr. De Brandeis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Mr. De Brandeis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophie.</span> The gentleman is waiting below
in a carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Tell that gentleman to go
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> It was too beautiful, too good
to be true. Now it will never be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> Why not? I shall give you
the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Father, I tell you it can never
be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vennema.</span> What do you mean? What
are you going to do, Louise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise.</span> Father, I can't go back home
with you. [<i>To Sophie.</i>] Take the
flowers and tell Mr. De Brandeis that&mdash;that&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Vennema sinks into a chair. Sophie
stands at the door with the flowers.
Van der Elst stands listening
anxiously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louise</span> [<i>with a sob in her throat</i>]. Tell
him, that I am going to stand by him.</p>

twitching her handkerchief nervously.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>There is only this notable thing to be
said about Grandmother&mdash;her hair is
snow white, her cheeks rosy and her eyes
violet blue. She is the most youthful and
enthusiastic, best and most cordial grandmother
ever beloved by her grandchildren.</i></p>

<p><i>The scene opens on a broad, sunny terrace
furnished with garden furniture,
chairs, small tables and chaises longues.
Back of the terrace is the beautiful summer
residence of Grandpa. Behind it is
a large English garden in its lenten blossoms.
The Disagreeable Young Man enters;
yawns; stretches discontentedly;
slouches here and there; picks up a volume
from the table, then falls into a couch
at right and, lighting a cigarette, begins
to read. The other grandchildren enter
in groups of two and three and seat themselves.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> My word,
children, I am too full for utterance.
What a spread! Now for a good cigar
and a soft chair and I am as rich as a
king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond Young Lady.</span> We are having
such charming weather. Is not this
park like a paradise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brunette Young Lady.</span> How did
you like the after-dinner speeches?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> Uncle Heinrich
was splendid. [<i>There is great laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Uncle Heinrich
was never strong in speechmaking,
but in the beginning even Demosthenes
stuttered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> The trouble
is that Uncle Heinrich stopped where
Demosthenes began. Besides a manufacturer
has no time to parade on the sea
shore with pebbles under his tongue.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is more laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Children,
who wants a cigarette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond and Brunette Young
Ladies.</span> I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man</span> [<i>handing them
cigarettes and lighting a match for them.
He speaks to the Bride</i>]. Aren't you
going to smoke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bride.</span> No, I thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> Lord, no!
She must not! The noble bride must not
permit tobacco smoke to contaminate her
rosy lips. [<i>They all laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> May I have a
cigarette, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> You be careful
or the same misfortune may happen
to you at any minute that happened to
Lucy [<i>pointing to the Bride, he hands the
Vivacious Girl a cigarette.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> If my bridegroom
shall object to tobacco smoke, he
can pack his things and&mdash;off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brunette Young Lady.</span> Well,
young people, what are we going to do
next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Melancholy Young Lady.</span> Let's
remain here. The park looks so beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond Young Lady.</span> Oh, I object.
We'll remain here until the sun
goes down a little and then we'll play
tennis. [<i>They agree.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Melancholy Young Lady.</span> Can't
we remain here? Let us enjoy the spring
in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> Let's play
tennis. A little exercise is the best cure
for romance. And you can enjoy your
spring out there as well&mdash;you dreamer.
[<i>They laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> You
are as loud as the besiegers of Jericho in
your planning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jovial Young Man.</span> Behold!
He speaketh. [<i>They laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> You
are so overbearing in your jollifications
that it is positively disgusting. For the
past hour you have been giggling away
without the slightest reason. You have
so much leisure you do not know what
to do with yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brunette Young Lady.</span> Curt,
must you always be the killjoy in a party!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> If
you would at least take yourselves off
from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brunette Young Lady.</span> But admit
that to-day there is reason enough
for every kind of jollity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Is
there, indeed? You have finished a costly
banquet and now are enjoying a good
digestion. You are young and have a
healthy animal appetite; but why deck
sentimentalism on your horns?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Your pardon!
Do you suppose that all a person
gets out of this remarkable occasion is a
good dinner? Have you no appreciation?
Do you realize what this day means to all
of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Very
well, my boy. Now tell me why you are
so over-filled with joy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Yes, I will.
I am glad that I can celebrate the golden
wedding of my grandfather. I am glad
that just thirty years ago to-day grandfather
founded his factory. I am glad
because of our large and happy family
and that so many lovely and good and
happy people have come here to celebrate
this remarkable event; all of them good
and prosperous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Prosperous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Yes, I rejoice
at their prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> The
laborers down there in the foundry, however,
are not as over-joyed at this prosperity
as you are. For this prosperity
of yours they have been starving these
past thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Grandfather
was always good to his employees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Indeed!
Our grandfather has managed by
hook or by crook to amass an enormous
fortune and you are glad that his fortune
is now made and you do not have
to resort to questionable means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man</span> [<i>hurt</i>].
Questionable means? You do not intend
to assert that our grandpapa....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> I assert
nothing. But mark you this. There
is only one honest way to gain a large
fortune: inheriting it. You cannot earn
it without resorting to questionable
means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Shame! to
say a thing like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brunette Young Lady.</span> Shame
to say that of grandfather.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>All of them are upset and disturbed.
Grandmother appears on the balcony.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Why, children, what
is it? What's wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
Why, grandma, just think of it! Curt
said that grandpa made his fortune by
questionable means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> I did
not say exactly that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Polite Young Man.</span> Yes, you
did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Others</span> [<i>chiming in</i>]. You said
that. Yes, you said that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>as energetically as
possible for her</i>]. I think you are in
error, Curt. In the entire fortune of
your grandpa there is not a single copper
that was not earned by him in the most
honest way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> But
look, grandma,&mdash;what I said was&mdash;generally
in those cases no one&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>hurt</i>]. When I tell
you this, boy, it <i>is so</i>. When I tell you
anything, my child, you should never
doubt it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Yes,
grandma, you are quite right. But I

<p class="salute">[<i>The Disagreeable Young Man shrugs
his shoulder and buries his head in
his book. Grandmother begins to
narrate, and the circle of her admiring
and attentive audience
grows narrower.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Well, my children, it
happened in the year eighteen hundred
and forty, a year after grandfather was
almost shot by error. In those days the
happenings took us quite far away from
here to <i>Friedrichsrode</i>, my dears, where
you have never been. Your grandfather
had a small estate there, and that's how
we made our livelihood. We always
wished and prayed to get the management
of the large estate of the Count of
Schwanhausen. But we lived there humbly
in the little house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond Young Lady.</span> Was my
mamma home then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> No, she was not in this
world yet. But a year later she was
born. So your grandfather and I lived
then in this little red-roofed house. Your
grandfather used to be busy with the land
the entire day. Those days I was taking
on weight, and to reduce I would take
long walks through the country. One
day in October&mdash;in the afternoon&mdash;it
was beautiful sunny autumn weather&mdash;as
usual I went again on my long walk.
The country there is very beautiful&mdash;all
hills&mdash;covered with dense forests. This
afternoon my way led into the famous
forest of <i>Friedrichsrode</i>. When there I
kept on walking&mdash;here and there I would
stop to pick a flower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond Young Lady.</span> Don't forget,
grandma, that it was quite late when
you left your house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> You are correct, my
dear. After our dinner I had some things
to attend to in the house and that is
why I started that day later than usual.
I was walking through the forest, going
in deeper and deeper and suddenly I began
to realize that it was getting dark.
It was in the autumn and the days were
getting short. When I saw how dark it
was I turned homeward. But in the
meanwhile evening came sooner than I
counted, and suddenly it got dark altogether.
Now, thought I, I must hustle.
I hurried, as well as I could, but as much
as I hurried I did not get home. Had I
gone home the right way I would have
reached it then, and so it dawned on me
that I had lost my way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
Great Heavens....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Indeed, my child, I
was really lost in the woods and in the
<i>Friedrichsrode</i> forest, besides. What
that meant you cannot now realize.
Since that time these woods have been
considerably cleared. Then also we live
in a different world to-day. But in those
days <i>Friedrichsrode</i> forest was a very,
very dismal place. It spread away into
the outskirts of the Harz Mountains and
was a wild, prim&aelig;val, godforsaken forest
where highway robbers were hiding. And
in the winter it was full of the wolves
from the mountains.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a short pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> And what did
you do, grandmother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Really, my child, a
great anxiety came upon me. I stood
still and tried to fix my direction. Then
I turned to a path which I figured ought
to lead me home. After I walked a half
hour, however, I found that the forest
instead of getting lighter was getting
thicker and thicker. Three or four times
I changed the direction, but no matter
what I did I was walking deeper and
deeper into the dark woods. Although
the moon was shining then, the branches
of the trees were so thick that I could
see but little. And that which I saw only
frightened me all the more. Every tree
stump, every overhanging bough excited
my fear. My feet were continuously
caught in the roots of big trees and the
undergrowth tore my bleeding face and
feet; and it was getting cold. I felt
frozen. And dismally quiet, terribly
dark was the night in the forest.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a pause and suspense.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
Good heavens, how perfectly terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Then I collected all
my wits. I said to myself, if I keep on
walking I will lose my way all the more.
I ought to remain where I am and wait.
When grandfather arrives at home and
misses me he will start a search with all
the help and people. They will go into
the woods with torchlights&mdash;and then I
will see the lights from the distance and
hear them call&mdash;and in that way I can
get home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Melancholy Girl.</span> How clever
of our grandma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> And how brave!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> After I figured it out
that way I looked about for a sheltered
nook. In between two great big tree
trunks there was a cave, like a little
house, a place all filled with soft moss.
A pleasant camping place. I fell into
this and prepared myself for a long wait.
I waited and waited. The night peopled
the woods with every kind of sound.
There was whistling, whispering, humming,
blowing, screeching and once from
a distance a long-drawn deep howling.
This, undoubtedly, was the wolves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl</span>
[<i>frightened</i>]. Merciful God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Then even I lost my
courage. I wanted to run, run as long
as my legs would carry me. But I realized
that the wiser thing was to be
brave and to remain. So I set my teeth
and kept on waiting. And then gradually
the howling ceased. So, I sat there
on this moss bank gazing before me and
thought of many things. Suddenly I
heard a noise. I straightened up and
listened. It was a breaking sound and
a rustle as though some one were brushing
aside the underbrush.... The noise was
getting nearer and nearer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> I was all ears. I
could clearly distinguish now that the
sound was the footstep of a human being.
Frightened, I started through the darkness
and in the dull moonlight I saw that
actually a man was wading through the
thick underbrush. What was I to do?
I pressed against the tree trunk and my
fast and loud-beating heart seemed to be
in my throat. The man was coming directly
toward me. When he was about
three paces away from me and I could
distinguish his features, I felt like fainting.
It was "Red Mike," a very dangerous
fellow from our neighborhood; every
one knew that he was a robber. Later
on he was imprisoned for murder, but he
escaped from the prison. Now he was
there.... What should I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>].
What did you do, grandma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
Great heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Frenzied, I pressed
against the tree trunk. I wanted to hide,
but the robber came directly toward me.
It was as though he could see me even in
this darkness and behind the tree trunk.
Later on when he was caught, I found
out, that he had prepared this very place
for his night's resting place. He had
brought all this soft moss there. Of
course, I did not know that he just came
there to rest himself. All I saw was that
he was making directly for me. Then
such a great fear seized me that instead
of pressing against the tree and letting
him go past me I shrieked just as he came
within reaching distance and began to
run away.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a pause and feverish suspense.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Melancholy Young Lady.</span> And
what did the robber do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> My sudden outcry and
quick dash and flight scared him for the
moment, but as soon as I appeared in
the moonlight, he saw that it was only a
woman who had frightened him. He
hesitated about a half a minute and then
started to pursue me. I flew. I was
young then and I could run fast. But it
was dark and I did not know my way.
As I pressed forward I ran into a low
branch and tore my cheek so that it bled.
My skirt was torn into shreds. Suddenly
I stumbled and fell to the ground. I
hurt myself quite painfully, but in spite
of that I rose quickly again and commenced
to run. And the robber after me
all the time. I could always hear his
footsteps in my wake. My legs were
about to give up under me when I got
an idea to hide behind a stout tree trunk.
But the robber began to look through the
underbrush in the spot where he last saw
me and he finally found me. He came
near me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> How terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> With one single leap I
jumped aside and started to run again.
Once more I fell down and again I rose.
Aimlessly I ran wildly over roots and
stones and the robber kept right on after
me.... And the distance between me
and my pursuer was getting smaller and
smaller. Then all of a sudden I heard
the sound of his footsteps close to me&mdash;to
escape him I tried to dash away to
the side of him but with a sudden leap he
was by my side. Grabbing me by my
shoulder he threw me on the ground and
I fell upon my back. He had run so fast
that he dashed a couple of paces past me.
He turned about.... And then I saw
that he had a long knife in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl</span>
[<i>horrified</i>]. Merciful heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> I could not budge....
And unspeakable fear seized me....
Then I uttered a piercing shriek....
The robber approached me.... I cried
out....</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Melancholy Girl.</span> Then, then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vivacious Girl.</span> Well, what then?
What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> I cried out like an insane
person.... Now the robber was
near me.... He bent over me.... Suddenly
a voice sounded,&mdash;<i>"who is crying
here?</i>" the voice seemed to be near&mdash;the
footsteps were audible&mdash;"who's crying
here?" it asked the second time.... The
branches parted and a man in a hunting
habit with a gun in his hand appeared.
The robber took to his heels and flew into
the woods. The hunter now came near
me and called to a second man who followed.
They helped me to rise and they
carried me over to a small clearing.
There I saw a light buggy into which
they lifted me. Soon they fetched the
horses and in a half hour I was in the
Schwanhausen castle sipping hot brandy
which they had prepared for me. The
man in the hunting habit was the Count
of Schwanhausen, who had been hunting
in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sentimental High School Girl.</span>
How interesting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> In the castle I quite
recovered. Then the Count ordered another
carriage to drive me home and at
six in the morning I landed safely in our
house. Your grandpa was sick with worry....
He and his people had searched
for me in the woods for hours. And
that's how I was almost lost. A few days
later grandpa went to thank the Count
for my rescue. The Count took a liking
to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Blond Young Lady.</span> That was
the old Count?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Yes, it was the old
Count. The benefactor of all of us.
Grandfather thanked him courteously for
my rescue. The Count took a liking to
him and soon after that grandfather got
the management of the entire Schwanhausen
estate, which proved the cornerstone
of his good fortune. And that, my
dears, is the story of my night wander in
the forest of <i>Friedrichsrode</i>.</p>

hour and a half spent in wandering&mdash;that
brings us to seven o'clock.
You now reached the night lodging of the
robber&mdash;here you were resting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Quite
right. Here you were waiting and resting&mdash;now
we want to allow a long time
for it&mdash;three&mdash;let us say&mdash;three and a
half hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>involuntarily</i>]. Not
that long....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Oh,
yes ... let us ... we'll then have reached
half-past ten o'clock. It could not have
been later when this forest bandit came.
These pirates never go to their bed
earlier. They shun light and must get
their sleep while the world is the darkest.
He could not sleep during the day even
in the darkest forests. In short, then, it
was half-past ten?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Half-past ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> Now
began the flight and the pursuit. You
ran&mdash;let us say&mdash;full twenty minutes.
That is a great deal. I was a track runner
in college and I know what a twenty-minute
stretch means. Shall we say
twenty minutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Twenty minutes....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> In
any circumstances it was not even eleven
when you were safely out of danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> And&mdash;and
a half hour later you were sipping
hot brandy in the Schwanhausen castle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Disagreeable Young Man is silent.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>shaking with excitement</i>].
And&mdash;what else?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Disagreeable Young Man is silent.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>she shakes with fear
as to what will follow, but forces herself
to face it</i>]. Well, say on ... what
else?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> At
six on the following morning you reached
your home and.... [<i>He pauses.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> [<i>if her loud-speaking
could be called an outcry, then she cries
out</i>]. Yes ... what else?... What
happened then?... Go on ... say it
... what else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Disagreeable Young Man.</span> [<i>He
makes a new attempt to tell everything
bravely at once, but hesitates.</i>] In the
morning at six you arrived at home. The
others had no idea as to the distance between
<i>Schwanhausen</i> and <i>Friederichsrode</i>.
But I wanted to see it myself, so
last year with a friend I made a walking
trip through that country. I tried this
distance. In a half hour of slow walking
I reached from one place to the other,
and the horses in the Count's stables and
the state roads were then in as good condition
as to-day. Well, then you started
from the castle at half-past five in the
morning; but you reached there at half-past
eleven the preceding night.... You
spent six entire hours in the castle....
Then, another point&mdash;they all speak of
the count, the "benefactor of us all," as
the "old count."... When he died five
years ago he was, of course, an old count&mdash;an
old man of seventy.... But thirty-five
years ago he was a young count of
thirty years of age.</p>

The Grandmother rises. She is

<p class="salute">[<i>Servant&mdash;Maddalena enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Well, has he returned yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> He has taken a lot of time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> I have been to look for
him at the post-office caf&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I told you to look in his room
or in the garden. Was it necessary to
run all over the country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Well, he wasn't there. I
thought&mdash;he wasn't at the caf&eacute; either,
but they told me where he was. He'll be
back shortly. He went to the station at
Poggio to meet the engineer of the water-works.
The tax collector saw him walking
in that direction. He always walks.
But he will return by the stage for the
engineer's sake. The stage should be
here at any moment. It is sure though&mdash;but
are you listening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, you may go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Yes, sir. But it is sure
that if the engineer of the water-works
really has arrived, your brother will not
go away to-morrow. You and the Madame
intend leaving to-morrow, don't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes, no. I don't know&mdash;yes,
we will go to-morrow. Leave me alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> All right, but see if I'm
wrong; I say that your brother will not
go to-morrow, nor the day after to-morrow.
Here he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Were you looking for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes, for the last hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Mr. Paolo&mdash;here asked
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I did not ask you anything.
Go away. [<i>He takes her by the arm and
pushes her out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What has happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She is insufferable. She isn't
listening at the door, is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No, be calm. I hear her in
the garden. What has happened. You
look worried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Do you
know why Luciano killed himself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> He killed himself for love.
For the love of Anna. I have the proofs&mdash;they
are there. I just found it out
to-day, a moment ago. He has killed
himself for the love of my wife. You
and I were his relatives; he was a companion
of my youth, my dearest friend.
He tried to force her to love him. Anna
repulsed him. He insisted; Anna responded
firmly. Highly strung as he
was, he killed himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> How did you find out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I have the proofs, I tell you.
I have been reading them for an hour.
I am still stunned! They have been there
for a month. You know that as soon as
I received the telegram in Milan which
announced his suicide in London, I ran
to Luciano's room and gathered all his
papers, made a packet of them, sealed it
and brought them here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I told you to burn them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I wanted to in fact, but afterward
I thought it better to await until
the authorities of the hospital, to whom
he left the estate, had verified the accounts.
The Syndic came here an hour
ago, at the order of the sub-Prefect, to
give me the wallet which was found on
the body and which our Consul at London
had sent to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
I was just putting them away into
the desk, when I felt the desire, I don't
know why, to look for the reason of his
suicide which no one seemed able to explain.
[<i>Mario starts.</i>] You know? You
suspect the reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I suspected&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Suspected! You knew of this
love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> There, there&mdash;I will tell you,
don't excite yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No&mdash;answer me! You knew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I felt it&mdash;yes, that Luciano
had lost his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And you never told me anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What had I to tell you? Seen
by others these things appear greater and
more offensive than they are. And then
I might have been wrong; I only see you
and Anna during your short visits to the
country. If you, who are with her all the
year, did not see anything&mdash;On the
other hand, Anna was always on her
guard, she knew perfectly how to defend
herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh, Anna! Anna is a saint!
I have always thought of her as one. But
now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> GO on&mdash;tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> In the wallet I found a letter
and noticed it was in Anna's handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> It was perfectly natural that
your wife should write to our cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Naturally. In fact I have
read it. Here it is. [<i>Mario starts to
take the letter.</i>] No, listen. [<i>Paolo
reads.</i>] "You write me&mdash;" [<i>Speaking.</i>]
There is no heading. [<i>Reads.</i>]
"You write me that if I do not respond
you will return immediately. I love my
husband, that is my reply. This and only
this forever. I beg you not to torment
me. Anna."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> The scoundrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What date is that letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Luciano himself has noted the
hour and date when he received it. He
has written here in pencil: "Received
to-day, June 26th, 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>" He killed
himself before noon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Poor devil! One can see it
was a stroke of insanity; the writing
demonstrates that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You understand of course,
that I did not stop there. I opened the
wallet. I found four other letters from
Anna all on the same subject and in the
same tone. The first is of three years
ago. There are few words; returning a
letter Luciano had written. I looked for
this letter of Luciano&mdash;it is not here.
He must have destroyed it. He kept
only hers. Then there is a little note
from Rome; you know Anna visited her
mother in Rome for a month last winter.
It is evident that our friend followed her.
Anna would not see him. Then there is
a long one which must have been written
when he was recovering from that fall
he had from his horse. It is the only
long one among the five&mdash;written in affectionate
terms, reasoning and begging;
a wonderful letter, good, noble; read&mdash;read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>turning away</i>]. No, no, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Listen, just a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I don't like to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She does nothing but speak
of me, of our brotherly youth. She also
speaks of you. She says&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No, I beg of you. It is useless.
I know what kind of a woman my
sister-in-law is and I do not need proofs
of her virtue. Why do you bother with
those poor letters? Is it so painful that
you have found them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Painful? It is painful that I
am not able to weep for a false relative
who wished to rob&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Let him alone. He is dead
and he has not robbed you of anything.
If he had lived he would not have robbed
you of anything, the same. Anna knew how&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And this? And this? You
count as little? Is this painful? I never
had the shadow of a <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'doube'">doubt</ins> about Anna,
but&mdash;nor has the thought even passed
through my mind&mdash;but it is different not
to have doubted and not to have thought,
than to possess the palpable proof of her
faith and love. "I love my husband."
It is the refrain of all her letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Was it necessary that she tell
you this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She did not tell it to me, she
told it to him. She told it to him&mdash;do
you understand? Luciano had all the
qualities which attract a woman. He
was younger, better looking than I, well
spoken, full of fire and courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> How it pleases you, eh? To
praise him now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Painful? If I had burned, as
you wished, those papers and then one
day I should have discovered this love,
who could then have lifted this suspicion
from my mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> The certainty makes you suspicious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> If you had feared this a year
ago, that which has happened would not
have occurred. I was wrong not to have
opened your eyes. A long way off, perhaps
Luciano would not have killed himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> But I would have lacked the
proof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Your tranquility costs much&mdash;to
the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You can't pretend that I
should feel badly about the fate of Luciano?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I am not speaking of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Of whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Of your wife. Think what she
must be suffering!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Do you think she blames herself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I have noticed that she was
distressed but not agitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You do not see the continuous
things, you only see the unexpected.
Besides, Anna is mistress of herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And she has done her duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> It is a long time that she has
done her duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I shall know how to comfort
her, there, I shall know how to cheer her.
You shall see, Mario. I feel that we
have returned to the first days of our
marriage, that I possess her only from
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Leave it to time. You have
read&mdash;you have known. It is enough.
It is useless that Anna knows you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She was here when the Syndic
gave me the wallet. But she went out
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> She does not know, then, that
you have read?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She will have imagined it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No. And in any case she
would be grateful if you pretended to
ignore....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Let us be frank. Don't let's
argue. Nothing is more dreadful than
to plan out a line of conduct in these
matters. What she has done, Anna has
done for me. I must think how to repay
her. She has done this for me, for
me, do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> And who says the contrary?
See how you excite yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Excite myself! Certainly, I
will not go and say: "I have read your
letters and I thank you very much!"
One understands that when I speak of
comforting her and of cheering her I intend
to do it with the utmost tenderness,
with the utmost confidence. I have always
been like that. That was why she
loved me. There is no need to change
even to please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> How you take it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> It is you who take it badly.
You have not said a just word to me.
I thought better of you. One would say,
to hear you, that this discovery was a
disgrace. What has happened new from
this discovery? Luciano is dead a month
ago, the first grief is passed. If I did
continue to ignore everything he would
not return to life! He did not arrive to
do me the harm he wanted to; so peace
be to his soul. There remains the certainty
of my wife's love and for this,
think as you wish, I rejoice for the best
fortune which could befall me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Come here. [<i>He places an
arm around  Paolo's shoulders.</i>] Are you
persuaded that I love you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Well then, if you are content,
so am I. Is it all right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes. Now go and pack your
bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Ah, that reminds me, I cannot
go to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> The engineer Falchi has arrived.
The day after to-morrow there
is the meeting of the water-company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Send it to the devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I cannot, I am the president.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> It was arranged that we were
to leave to-day. We put it off on your
account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> How could it be helped? I
had to sell the hay. It is now a question
of three days, four at the most.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Suppose Anna and I go meanwhile?
The rent of the chalet started
fifteen days ago. You can join us as
soon as you are free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> If you think so&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I'll tell you. The day after
to-morrow is Anna's birthday. Until
the business kept me in Milan all of
July, we always passed that day together&mdash;just
Anna and I. We did not do this
on purpose, but things turned out so.
Last year I was able to be free early in
July and we came here to stay until September.
Well, three days before her
birthday, Anna begged me to take her
for a trip to Switzerland. She did not
tell me, you understand, the reason for
her desire, but insisted upon leaving immediately.
We went to Interlaken and
from there we went up to Murren. The
day of Saint Anna we were at Murren.
The place was so lovely, Anna liked it so
much, that then and there I arranged for
a chalet for this year. Fifteen days ago
you&mdash;who never go anywhere, proposed
to accompany us&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Did you find it indiscreet of
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No. You saw that Anna was
pleased. She is very fond of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> When you had to postpone
your leaving it was the same as to propose
that we wait for you. But the first
delay would still have allowed us to arrive
in time; this second one will not and
I, for my part, now especially desire to
be there at the date arranged. It is
childish if you wish&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No. All right. I will join you
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> We postponed leaving until to-morrow
to await you; but now that you
cannot come immediately we could leave
this evening. [<i>Jumping up.</i>] I must
go&mdash;to get out of here. Those letters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Burn them. Give them to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Ah, no. Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Go. Go to-night; it is better.
But will Anna be ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> [<i>Who has entered.</i>] To do
what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I was telling Paolo that I could
not leave to-morrow; nor for three or
four days. It is useless that you two
remain here in the heat to wait for me.
Paolo must be back in Milan at the beginning
of September; every day shortens
his vacation. I am old enough to
travel alone; as soon as I am free I will
join you. What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> As you wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I also desire to thoroughly
clean the house and garden. Your presence
would disturb me, and mine is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And as Mario cannot accompany
us, we may as well leave this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> So soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Your luggage is almost finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You will gain a day. At this
season of the year it is better to travel
by night than by day. It is full moon
now and the Gottard road is charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span> [<i>distractedly</i>]. Yes. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>to Paolo</i>]. Then you had better
go immediately to the stable in the
piazza and tell them to hold a carriage
in readiness. At what time does the train
leave from Poggio?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> At seven-thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Tell him to be here at six. I
would send Battista to order it, but the
engineer has taken him with him. On the
other hand, it is better that you see the
carriage, they have some antediluvian
arks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And why don't you go? He
knows you and you know his arsenal&mdash;you
could choose better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You are right. Anna, I will
send Maddalena to help you with your
luggage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Yes, thank you, Mario. Send
Maddalena to help me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>going off</i>]. And dinner is at
five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mario exits. Silence. Anna takes
a few steps toward the desk.
Paolo goes impetuously to Anna
and takes her in his arms and kisses
her. She breaks away violently.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Oh&mdash;horrors! [<i>The words
escape from her lips involuntarily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo</span> [<i>drawing back</i>]. Anna!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> There was one of my letters in
that wallet, wasn't there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes, there was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You have read it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I have killed a man and you
embrace me for that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I did not want to. I was
tempted not to tell you. Mario advised
me not to. Then when I saw you&mdash;you
filled me with tenderness! But what did
you say, Anna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Pardon me. And promise me
that you will never speak of all this
again, either here or hereafter, directly
or indirectly&mdash;never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You will not keep your promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You will not keep it. I know
you. What a misfortune that you should
have known it! I saw it in your eyes
when I came in, that you knew. I had
hoped that you would always have ignored
it. I prayed so. But as soon as I entered
I saw immediately. [<i>With imperceptible
accent of mocking pity.</i>] You
had a modest and embarrassed air. I
know you so well. Do you want to hear
how well? When Mario proposed you
go for the carriage, I thought&mdash;he will
not go. When you sent him instead, I
smiled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I noticed it, but I did not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> That's nothing. That you
should read me is natural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> In exchange, eh? And listen&mdash;when
Mario was leaving, I also thought&mdash;now
the minute we are alone&mdash;he will
come to me and embrace me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You imagine very well....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> This was also natural, wasn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I love you so much, Anna. [<i>A
long pause.</i>] It is strange that in your
presence I have a sense of restraint. I
tell you something and immediately I
think should I tell her? Was it better I
kept silent? It is the first time I have
had this feeling toward you. We both
need distraction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Yes, but to-day I do not leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No? But you said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I have thought better. There
is not the time to get ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Your luggage is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Oh, there is a lot to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> We have eight hours yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I am tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Mario has just gone to order
the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> It can be for another day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Perhaps to-morrow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Not to-day, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I do not know how to tell
Mario. It looks like a whim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Oh, Mario will understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> More than I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I did not wish to say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Anna, you do not pardon me
for having read those letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You see, you have already begun
to speak of them again! Well, no,
no, no, poor Paolo, it is not that. I have
nothing to pardon. Believe me. I feel no
wrath or bitterness. I would have given,
I don't know what, if you had ignored
them; for you, for your own good, for
your peace, not for me. But I felt that
some time or other&mdash;[<i>Pause.</i>] It has
been a useless tragedy&mdash;you will see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I don't know, don't mind me&mdash;excuse
me&mdash;[<i>Moves up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> So you won't tell me if we go
to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> We have time to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh, rather. [<i>Anna exits.
Silence.</i>] A useless tragedy! [<i>Sits with
his elbows upon his knees and his head in
his hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>coming in</i>]. There, that is
done. And Anna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She's there. [<i>Points off.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Maddalena will be here immediately,
she was still at the wash-house.
Well? Come, come, shake yourself, throw
off that fixed idea. One knows that at
the first opportunity&mdash;You do well to
leave immediately, the trip will distract
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> We do not go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Anna does not want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo</span> [<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> She said so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> She understood, she asked me....
I could not deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> She asked of her own accord,
without you saying anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Do me the favor of not judging
me now. If you knew what I am
thinking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Do you wish that I speak to
her? I am convinced that to remain
here is the worse thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Try it. Who knows? You
understand her so well! She said so herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> And you promise me not to
worry meanwhile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> What is the use of promising?
I wouldn't keep it. She said that also.
She knows me. Don't you know me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Is she in her room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Leave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Look out. If&mdash;no, no, go&mdash;go&mdash;we
shall see afterwards. [<i>Mario
exits. Paolo takes a letter from the wallet,
reads it attentively, accentuating the
words.</i>] "You write me that if I do not
respond you will return immediately."
[<i>Speaks.</i>] You write me! Where is that
letter? [<i>Reads.</i>] "I love my husband,
that is my response. This and only this
forever. I beg you not to torment me."
[<i>Speaks.</i>] I beg you not to torment me.
Ummm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Here I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I do not want you. It is not
necessary now. If I need you I will call
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Excuse me, Mr. Paolo, is
it true what they say in the village?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> That the Syndic brought
the wallet of Mr. Luciano this morning
with a lot of money in it for the poor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Why&mdash;no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> The servant of the Syndic
said so just now at the wash-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> There was nothing in it, the
Syndic also knows that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Oh, it would not have
been a surprise. Mr. Luciano came here
rarely, but when he did he spent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I am glad to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Last year, to Liberata, the
widow of the miner who went to America
to join his son and to whom you gave
fifty lire, well, Mr. Luciano gave her a
hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> What a story! He wasn't
even here at that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Wasn't even here? I
saw him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Nonsense. That woman received
word that her husband was killed
in the mine and that the son wanted her
to come to America, the day I left for
Switzerland, a year ago yesterday or to-day;
I remember it because I gave her a
little money in gold which I had been
able to procure. She was to leave two
days later....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> There you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> There you are nothing. Luciano
was not there. I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> He arrived the day Liberata
started on the trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh, two days after we left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Yes it was. He arrived
in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> At his villa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> No, no, here; but he
found only Mr. Mario; he was annoyed,
poor man, and left immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Ah, I did not know that....
Then you are right. Ah, so he came?
You are right. Oh, he was generous! He
left all to the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Yes, yes. But what hospital?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>off stage calls</i>]. Maddalena!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maddalena.</span> Here I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> [<i>entering</i>]. Go to Madame, she
needs you. [<i>Maddalena exits.</i>] [<i>To
Paolo.</i>] I have persuaded her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> How fortunate to have a good
lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> And as you see, it did not take
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Want to bet I know how you
convinced her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Oh, it was very easy&mdash;I said....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, let me tell you. I want
my little triumph. You gave up the
business which held you here and decided
to leave with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Even that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Eh? Didn't I know it? When
you went away I was just about to tell
you and then I wanted to wait and see.
So now Anna is disposed to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Are you sorry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I should say not! All the
more as we are&mdash;are we not going to
amuse ourselves? The place, the trip,
the hotels,&mdash;yes, it is better. But the
company! To run away there should be
few of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo</span> [<i>putting his two hands on
Mario's shoulders and facing him.</i>] To
run away&mdash;do you understand? We
must be a few. To run away as Anna
and I did last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I do not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You did not tell me that Luciano
had been here last year, nor the day
that he was here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I don't know. I do not remember....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> There you are&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;I
knew it! And you knew that Anna
went away from here to avoid him. And
I went with her all unconscious. You
saw the husband take a train and run
away before the other could arrive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> And if it is true. It does not
tell you more or less than the letters did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, a little more. Everything
tells a little more. One grain of sand
piles up upon another, then another until
it makes the mill-stone which crushes you.
It tells a little more. It is one thing to
keep away and another to run away. One
can keep away a trouble without begging
it to keep its distance. But one runs
away for fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Uh-h!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And look here&mdash;look&mdash;look,
let us examine the case. Let us see. It
is improbable that he wrote her he was
coming. It is sure he did not or she
would have responded: "You write me
that you are coming.... I love my husband&mdash;I
beg you to remain away."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> So she, foreseeing his intentions,
felt that he would come ... by
that divination....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You are the first husband to
get angry because a wife did her duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Uhm! Duty&mdash;the ugly word!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> If there ever was a virtuous
woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Woman or wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> It is the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, no. A woman is for all;
a wife for myself alone. Do you believe
one marries a woman because she is virtuous?
Never! I marry her because I love
her and because I believe she loves me.
There are a thousand virtuous women,
there is one that I love, one alone who
loves me ... if there is one....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Paolo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And if she loved him? Tell
me&mdash;and if she loved him? And if she
repulsed him for virtue's sake, for duty's
sake? Tell me. What remains for me?
If he was alive I could fight, I might win
out. But he is dead&mdash;and has killed himself
for love of her. If she loved him no
force can tear him from her heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You think&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I do not know. It is that&mdash;I
do not know. And I want to&mdash;I want to
hear her shout it to my face. And she
shall tell me.... Oh, I had the feeling
the minute I had read the first letter. I
did not then understand anything, indeed,
I believed; "I love my husband." But I
immediately felt a blow here&mdash;and it
hurt me so! And I did not know what
it was. Oh, before some fears assume
shape, it takes time. First they gnaw,
they gnaw and one does not know what
they are. I was content.... I told you
I was content, I wanted to <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'pursuade'">persuade</ins> myself,
but you have seen that fear gnaws at
my heart. And if she loved him? Oh,
surely! The more admirable eh? All the
world would admire her. I, myself,
would admire her upon my knees if she
were the wife of another. But she is
mine. I am not the judge of my wife. I
am too intimately concerned, I cannot
judge, I am the owner&mdash;she is mine&mdash;a
thing of mine own. I must admire her
because, while she could have cheated me
altogether, she has only cheated me a
little. I see that which she has robbed
me of, not that which remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You are crazy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Do you not see that I am
odious to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Oh, God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Odious! You were not here a
moment ago. Don't you see that it is
necessary that she have your help in order
to support my presence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> To-day. Because she knows
that you have read&mdash;did I not tell you?
Because it is embarrassing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Not only to-day. You never
move from this place. For fifteen years
that you have played at being a farmer,
you have not been away for a week. And
fifteen days ago you suddenly decided to
make a tour of the world. She begged
you to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> I swear&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I do not believe you. Anna
shall have to tell me. [<i>Paolo starts to
exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I am going to ask her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No, Paolo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> No. Maddalena is also there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh, as far as that's concerned&mdash;[<i>Calls.</i>]
Anna&mdash;Anna!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You are very ungrateful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> If she loved me it did not come
hard for her to repulse him. If she loved
him, I owe her no gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span> [<i>entering</i>]. Did you call me?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mario starts to exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, no. Remain. Yes, Anna.
I wanted to ask you something. Whatever
you say, I shall believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Of that I am certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Was it you who begged Mario
to come with us? Not to-day I don't
mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Neither to-day nor before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> You see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I did not beg him nor did I
propose it to him. But I must say that
if Mario had not come I would not have
gone either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> To-day. But fifteen days ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Listen, this is ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> It is natural that Paolo desires
to know and he has the right to question
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> I do not wish to impose my
rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> There you are wrong. We
must value our own and respect those of
the others. Fifteen days ago I would
have gone with you alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Oh, blessed God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You were afraid that she
would say no?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> But his consent to accompany
us greatly relieved me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Which is to say that my
company would have weighed upon
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Not weighed. It would have
annoyed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> May one ask why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You may as well. Because I
was shadowed by an unhappiness which
you ignored at the time, whereas now
you know the reasons. Knowing them,
you will understand that I must be very
worried, but for the sake of your peace
I must hide my unhappiness, seeing that
I had nothing to reproach myself with
in relation to you. You understand that
for two to be together, always together,
it would be more difficult to pretend all
the time&mdash;all the time! While the presence
of a third person&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> But listen&mdash;listen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Mario had the good idea to accompany
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Mario, who knew him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I ignore that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Did he ever speak of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario.</span> Do not reply, Anna, do not
answer, come away&mdash;he is ill, he does not
reason&mdash;poor devil&mdash;it will pass and he
will understand then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> No, it is useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> A useless tragedy, isn't it,
Anna?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Do you require anything more
of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo</span> [<i>imperiously</i>]. Yes. I want the
letters which you wrote to Luciano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> That is just. I will go and
get them. [<i>Exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> All!</p>

his head, then indulgently and discouragingly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Rise&mdash;rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Tell me that you pardon me.
I swear that I want to die here and now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Yes, yes. Arise; do not remain
so. It hurts me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. I do not know
what got into my head&mdash;but I have suffered
a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Yes, I see. Yes ... calm
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Mario has no tact ... it was
he who irritated me from the first. [<i>Anna
starts to go.</i>] Do not go. Stay here a
moment. [<i>Anna sits upon the sofa.</i>]
You see the stroke of madness has passed.
It was only because Mario was here.
Mario is good, judicious, but his presence
irritated me. Yes, yes, you were right.
But you should also understand the state
of my mind. [<i>He walks up and down.</i>]
After all, what does all this disturbance
mean? It means that I love you&mdash;and it
seems to me that is the essential thing!
One must consider the source of things.
It is five years that we are husband and
wife and you cannot say I have ever
given you the slightest reason for regret.
I do not believe so. Five years are five
years. I have worked up to a good position,
you have always figured in society;
a pastime which I would never have enjoyed
alone. I had friends, the club, the
other husbands after the first year of
marriage, in the evenings, I renounced
everything. I do not wish to praise myself,
but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Please don't walk up and down
so much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Excuse me. Will you allow
me to sit here next to you? [<i>Long
silence.</i>] When shall I see you smile,
Anna? No, do not get up. Then it is
not true that you have pardoned me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> What do you wish, Paolo?
What do you wish of me? Say it quickly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> You made me promise never
to speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Oh, but I said that you would
break your promise immediately. You
are wrong though, believe me. Do not
ask me anything. When there is no more
danger I promise you, and I will keep
my promise. I promise that I will tell
you everything without your asking me.
And it will be good for both of us. But
I wish to choose the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> All right then. Do not tell me
anything, but come away with me, with
me alone. I will attend to Mario. He
was coming to please you and he will be
much happier to see us leave together, as
a sign of peace. I understand that it is
repulsive to you to re-awaken those memories;
all right, instead of awakening
them I will make you forget them&mdash;I
swear it&mdash;I swear that I will never speak
of them again, but come away with me
and you shall see how much love....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Do not insist, Paolo. If you
insist I shall come&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, no, I do not insist. You
see me here begging. I do not want you
by force. But listen once more, listen.
I am grateful, you must understand, for
that which you have done. Oh, I shall
recompense you for it all my life. I realize
there is not a more saintly woman in
all the world, but you must enter into
my soul and feel a little pity also for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Ah, ah! [<i>Laughs bitterly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Why do you prolong this torment?
You said when there is no more
danger! What danger is there? Upon
whom depends this danger&mdash;from you
or from me? What can time change for
us? I have always loved you, I love you
now, and in this moment I love you as I
have never loved you! Give me your
hand&mdash;only your hand. God, Anna!
You are beautiful! And you are my
wife&mdash;you are my wife and the oath
which you took when we were married,
is not only one of faithfulness, but of love.
Come away&mdash;come away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> No, no, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No? Are you afraid? Afraid
of being unfaithful to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Paolo&mdash;Paolo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And if I wish it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You cannot wish it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And if I want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Paolo!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> And if I command?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> You will, in one moment, destroy
all my plan. Think&mdash;your violence
is a liberation for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh, come&mdash;or speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Do you wish it so? We have
come to that? I have done all that I
could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Yes, go on. Speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I loved Luciano and I love him
still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> I loved him. I loved him&mdash;do
you hear? I loved him and I feel an
immense joy to say it here and you did
not see that I was dying to say it&mdash;and
when I saw you nearly stifling me with
your ferocious curiosity, I said to myself:
"It will out&mdash;it will out"...
And it has come. I loved him, I love him
and I have never loved any one in the
world but him and I feel only remorse
for my virtue. Now do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> Very well! [<i>Starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna.</span> Ah, no. Remain here&mdash;now
you hear me. You wished that I speak,
now I do.... It is I now who command
you to stay. You must understand very
well that after a scene such as this, everything
is finished between us, so I must tell
you everything. I listened to you and
will listen to you again if you wish, but
you also must listen to me. What have
you ever done for me? What help have
you given me? Have you known how to
see when it was right that you should see?
Have you known even how to suspect?
Was it necessary that a man die....
Not even that! When you were not suffering,
as you are suffering now, did you
know how to see the way I suffered? You
thought that my sorrow was for a dead
relative! You did not understand that
I was crazed; you slept next to me and
yet you did not realize that the first few
nights I bit the covers so as not to cry
out. In a moment you realize all the
facts. And what are these facts? That
I, your wife for many years, have defended
your peace in silence. I have fulfilled
that which people call my duty.
Then your curiosity is awakened and to
make up for lost time you wish to violate
my soul and penetrate down to its very
depths. Ah&mdash;Paolo, no, no; one cannot
do this. No, it will not help to know
everything. One does not enter into the
soul by the front door; one enters by
stealth. You have tried to force an entrance;
now you see there is nothing
more inside for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No? You think you are right,
eh? You are right&mdash;it is true&mdash;I admit
that you are right. So I have never had
your love, eh? You have said so; that
I never had your love! Then what?
You are right. Still&mdash;do you know what
I shall do? I throw you out of my house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span> [<i>happily</i>]. I go, I go, I go and
I shall never come back! And do not beg
me and do not come after me. I have
no more strength to have pity, when I
say good-by, I shall be as dead to you!
[<i>Runs off into her room. Paolo stunned,
stares after her awaiting for her return.
Anna returns with her hat and cloak,
crosses to exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paolo.</span> No, Anna, no, no, no. Anna,
no. For pity's sake wait! We are both
mad. What will become of us? I need
you. [<i>Paolo tries to get in her way to
stop her.</i>] Do not go. I do not want
you to&mdash;remain here. I was crazy&mdash;do
not go, you will see that&mdash;for all my
life&mdash;[<i>Anna tries to break away.</i>] No,
for pity's sake&mdash;if you go&mdash;if you break
from me&mdash;if you speak&mdash;I feel that this
will be the end of everything! Remain!
Remain, Anna! [<i>She breaks away.</i>]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A wild place in the mountains</i>.</p>

<p><i>A man in an attitude of despair is
standing on a tiny projection of a rock
that rises almost sheer from the ground.
How he got there it is not easy to say,
but he cannot be reached either from
above or below. Short ladders, ropes and
sticks show that attempts have been made
to save the unknown person, but without
success.</i></p>

<p><i>It seems that the unhappy man has
been in that desperate position a long
time. A considerable crowd has already
collected, extremely varied in composition.
There are venders of cold drinks;
there is a whole little bar behind which
the bartender skips about out of breath
and perspiring&mdash;he has more on his
hands than he can attend to; there are
peddlers selling picture postal cards,
coral beads, souvenirs, and all sorts of
trash. One fellow is stubbornly trying
to dispose of a tortoise-shell comb, which
is really not tortoise-shell. Tourists keep
pouring in from all sides, attracted by
the report that a catastrophe is impending&mdash;Englishmen,
Americans, Germans,
Russians, Frenchmen, Italians, etc., with
all their peculiar national traits of character,
manner and dress. Nearly all
carry alpenstocks, field-glasses and cameras.
The conversation is in different
languages, all of which, for the convenience
of the reader, we shall translate into
English.</i></p>

<p><i>At the foot of the rock where the unknown
man is to fall, two policemen are
chasing the children away and partitioning
off a space, drawing a rope around
short stakes stuck in the ground. It is
noisy and jolly.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> Get away, you loafer!
The man'll fall on your head and then
your mother and father will be making
a hullabaloo about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Will he fall here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> Yes, here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> Suppose he drops farther?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Policeman.</span> The boy is right.
He may get desperate and jump, land
beyond the rope and hit some people in
the crowd. I guess he weighs at least
about two hundred pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Policeman.</span> Move on, move on,
you! Where are you going? Is that
your daughter, lady? Please take her
away! The young man will soon fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady.</span> Soon? Did you say he is going
to fall soon? Oh, heavens, and my husband's
not here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> He's in the caf&eacute;, mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> [<i>desperately</i>]. Yes, of course.
He's always in the caf&eacute;. Go call him,
Nellie. Tell him the man will soon drop.
Hurry! Hurry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> Waiter!&mdash;Gar&ccedil;on&mdash;Kellner&mdash;Three
beers out here!&mdash;No beer?&mdash;What?&mdash;Say,
that's a fine bar&mdash;We'll
have some in a moment&mdash;Hurry up&mdash;Waiter!&mdash;Waiter!&mdash;Gar&ccedil;on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Policeman.</span> Say, boy, you're
here again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> I wanted to take the stone
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy.</span> So he shouldn't get hurt so badly
when he falls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Policeman.</span> The boy is right.
We ought to remove the stone. We ought
to clear the place altogether. Isn't there
any sawdust or sand about?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Two English tourists enter. They

<p><span class="smcap">First Tourist.</span> Twenty-eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Tourist.</span> Twenty-six. Fright
has made him look older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Tourist.</span> How much will you
bet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Tourist.</span>  Ten to a hundred.
Put it down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Tourist</span> [<i>writing in his notebook.
To the policeman</i>]. How did he
get up there? Why don't they take him
off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> They tried, but they
couldn't. Our ladders are too short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Tourist.</span> Has he been here
long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> Two days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Tourist.</span> Aha! He'll drop at
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Tourist.</span>  In two hours. A
hundred to a hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Tourist.</span> Put it down. [<i>He
shouts to the man on the rock.</i>] How
are you feeling? What? I can't hear
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown Man</span> [<i>in a scarcely audible
voice</i>]. Bad, very bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady.</span> Oh, heavens, and my husband
is not here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl</span> [<i>running in</i>]. Papa said
he'll get here in plenty of time. He's
playing chess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady.</span> Oh, heavens! Nellie, tell him
he must come. I insist. But perhaps I
had rather&mdash;Will he fall soon, Mr. Policeman?
No? Nellie, you go. I'll stay
here and keep the place for papa.</p>

It offers a good view, and that's just

his shoulders with an air of injury,

Children must be hardened to things.

Every roofer, when he falls, falls
from a great height. But this here&mdash;what
is it? A hundred, two hundred feet.
I saw a man fall plumb from the sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist</span> [<i>overwhelmed</i>]. You don't

<p><span class="smcap">Aleck.</span> Children, listen. Plumb from
the sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman.</span> Yes, yes. I saw an

crash upon an iron roof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> How terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman.</span> That's what I call
a tragedy. It took two hours to bring

<p><span class="smcap">First English Tourist.</span> One minute.
[<i>He shouts.</i>] Listen, won't you hurry up
and fall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second English Tourist.</span> What are
you saying, Sir William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First English Tourist</span> [<i>shouting</i>].
Don't you see that's what they are waiting
for? As a gentleman you should
grant them this pleasure and so escape
the humiliation of undergoing tortures before
this mob.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second English Tourist.</span> Sir William.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist</span> [<i>ecstatically</i>]. See? It's true.
Aleck, Jimmie, it's true. What a tragedy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several Tourists</span> [<i>going for the Englishman</i>].
How dare you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First English Tourist</span> [<i>shoving them
aside</i>]. Hurry up and fall! Do you
hear? If you haven't the backbone I'll
help you out with a pistol shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> That red-haired devil has gone
clear out of his mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman</span> [<i>seizing the Englishman's
hand</i>]. You have no right to do it, it's
against the law. I'll arrest you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some Tourists.</span> A barbarous nation!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The unknown man shouts something.
Excitement below.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> Hear, hear, hear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown Man</span> [<i>aloud</i>]. Take that
jackass away to the devil. He wants to
shoot me. And tell the boss that I can't
stand it any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> What's that? What boss? He
is losing his mind, the poor man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> Aleck! Mary! This is a
mad scene. Jimmie, you remember Hamlet?
Quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown Man</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Tell him
my spinal column is broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> [<i>wearily</i>]. Papa, children, he's
beginning to kick with his legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kate.</span> Is that what is called convulsions,
papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist</span> [<i>rapturously</i>]. I don't know.
I think it is. What a tragedy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleck</span> [<i>glumly</i>]. You fool! You keep
cramming and cramming and you don't
know that the right name for that is
agony. And you wear eyeglasses, too.
I can't bear it any longer, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> Think of it, children. A
man is about to fall down to his death
and he is bothering about his spinal column.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a noise. A man in a white
vest, very much frightened, enters,

seized and pulled again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> A bare-faced deception! It
is an outrage. Policeman, policeman, he
must be taught a lesson!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Voices.</span> What is it? What deception?
What is it all about? They
have caught a thief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man in the White Vest</span> [<i>bowing

gentlemen, a joke, that's all. The people
were bored, so I wanted to provide a
little amusement for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man in the White Vest.</span> Wait
a while, wait a while.</p>

to stay here until the Second Advent?
The agreement was till twelve o'clock.
What time is it now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tall Tourist</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. Do you
hear, ladies and gentlemen? This scoundrel,
this man here in the white vest hired
that other scoundrel up there and just
simply tied him to the rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> Is he tied?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tall Tourist.</span> Yes, he is tied and he
can't fall. We are excited and worrying,
but he couldn't fall even if he tried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown Man.</span> What else do you
want? Do you think I am going to break
my neck for your measly ten dollars?
Boss, I can't stand it any more. One
man wanted to shoot me. The pastor
preached me for two hours. This is not
in the agreement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleck.</span> Father, I told you that Baedeker
lies. You believe everything anybody
tells you and drag us about without
eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man in the White Vest.</span> The people
were bored. My only desire was to
amuse the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter?
I don't understand a thing. Why
isn't he going to fall? Who, then, is going
to fall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> I don't understand a thing
either. Of course he's got to fall!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> You never understand anything,
father. Weren't you told that he's
tied to the rock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleck.</span> You can't convince him. He
loves every Baedeker more than his own
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James.</span> A nice father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> Silence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter?
He must fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tall Tourist.</span> The idea! What a deception.
You'll have to explain this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man in the White Vest.</span> The people
were bored. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,

you a few hours of pleasant excitement&mdash;elevate

<p><span class="smcap">Man in the White Vest.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Englishman.</span> And is the hotel below

<p><span class="smcap">Gentleman.</span> Yes. The people were

you have me taken off at once or won't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hotel Keeper.</span> What do you want up
there? Aren't you satisfied? Didn't I
have you taken off at night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unknown Man.</span> Well, I should say
so. You think I'd be hanging here
nights, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hotel Owner.</span> Then you can stand it
a few minutes longer. The people are
bored&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tall Tourist.</span> Say, have you any idea
of what you have done? Do you realize
the enormity of it? You are scoundrels,
who for your own sordid personal ends
have impiously exploited the finest human
sentiment, love of one's neighbor. You
have caused us to undergo fear and suffering.
You have poisoned our hearts
with pity. And now, what is the upshot
of it all? The upshot is that this scamp,
your vile accomplice, is bound to the rock
and not only will he not fall as everybody
expects, but he <i>can't</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter?
He has got to fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> Policeman! Policeman!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The pastor enters, out of breath.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pastor.</span> What? Is he still living?
Oh, there he is! What fakirs those Salvationists
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> Don't you know that he is
bound?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pastor.</span> Bound! Bound to what? To
life? Well, we are all bound to life until
death snaps the cord. But whether he
is bound or not bound, I reconciled him
with heaven, and that's enough. But
those fakirs&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tourist.</span> Policeman! Policeman, you
must draw up an official report. There
is no way out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Military Woman</span> [<i>going for the hotel
owner</i>]. I will not allow myself to be
fooled. I saw an a&euml;ronaut drop from
the clouds and go crash upon a roof. I
saw a tiger tear a woman to pieces&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Photographer.</span> I spoiled three films
photographing that scamp. You will
have to answer for this, sir. I will hold
you responsible.</p>

it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hotel Keeper.</span> Excuse me. I promise
you on my word of honor that the next

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Mrs. Popov discovered in deep mourning,
sitting upon a sofa, gazing steadfastly
at a photograph. Luka is also
present.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> It isn't right, ma'am&mdash;You're
wearing yourself out! The maid and the
cook have gone looking for berries, everything
that breathes is enjoying life, even
the cat knows how to be happy&mdash;slips
about the courtyard and catches birds;
but you hide yourself here in the house as
though you were in a cloister and have
no pleasures&mdash;Yes, truly, by actual reckoning
you haven't left this house for a
whole year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> And I shall never leave
it&mdash;why should I? My life is over. He
lies in his grave, and I have buried myself
within these four walls. We are
both dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> There you are again! It's too
awful to listen to, so it is! Nikolai Michailovitch
is dead, it was the will of the
Lord and the Lord has given him eternal
peace. You have grieved over it and
that ought to be enough. Now it's time
to stop. One can't weep and wear mourning
forever! My wife died a few years
ago, too. I grieved for her, I wept a
whole month&mdash;and then it was over.
Must one be forever singing lamentations?
That would be more than your husband
was worth! [<i>He sighs.</i>] You have forgotten
all your neighbors. You don't go
out and you won't receive any one. We
live,&mdash;you'll pardon me&mdash;like the
spiders, and the good light of day we
never see. All the livery is eaten by the
mice&mdash;As though there weren't any more
nice people in the world! But the whole
neighborhood is full of gentlefolk. In
Riblov the regiment is stationed, officers&mdash;simply
beautiful! One can't see enough
of them! Every Friday a ball, and military
music every day. Oh, my dear, dear
ma'am, young and pretty as you are, if
you'd only let your spirits live! Beauty
can't last forever. When ten short years
are over, then you'll be glad enough to
go out a bit! And meet the officers&mdash;and
then it'll be too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>resolutely</i>]. Please, don't
speak of these things to me again. You
know very well that since the death of
Nikolai Michailovitch my life is absolutely
nothing to me. You think I live, but it
only seems that I live. Do you understand?
Oh, that his departed soul may
see how I love him&mdash;Oh, I know, it's no
secret to you; he was often unjust towards
me, cruel and&mdash;he wasn't faithful,
but I shall be faithful to the grave
and prove to him how I am able to love.
There, in the beyond, he'll find me the
same, as I was until his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> What is the use of all these
words? When you'd so much rather go
walking in the garden or order Tobby or
Welikan harnessed to the trap, and visit
the neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>weeping</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Madam, dear, dear Madam,
what is it? In heaven's name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> He loved Tobby so! He
always took him when he drove to the
Kortschagins or the Vlassovs. What
a wonderful horseman he was! How fine
he looked! When he pulled at the reins
with all his might! Tobby, Tobby, give
him an extra measure of oats to-day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A bell rings loudly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>shudders</i>]. What's that?
Say that I am receiving no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Yes, ma'am. [<i>He goes out
center.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>gazing at the photograph</i>].
You shall see, Nikol, how I can love and
forgive&mdash;My love will die only with me&mdash;when
my poor heart stops beating.
[<i>She smiles through her tears.</i>] And
aren't you ashamed? I have been a good,
true wife, I have imprisoned myself and
I shall remain true until the grave, and
you&mdash;you&mdash;you're not ashamed of yourself,
my dear monster! Betrayed me,
quarreled with me, left me alone for
weeks&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Luka enters in great excitement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Oh, ma'am, some one is asking
for you, insists on seeing you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> You told him that since
my husband's death I receive no one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> I said so, but he won't listen,
he says that it is a pressing matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I&mdash;re&mdash;ceive&mdash;no&mdash;one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> I told him that, but he's a wild-man,
he swore and pushed himself into
the room&mdash;he's in the dining room now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Good. Show
him in. What an intruder!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Luka goes out center.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> What a bore people are!
What can they want with me? Why do
they disturb my peace? [<i>She sighs.</i>]
Yes, it is clear I must go to a cloister.
[<i>Meditatively.</i>] Yes, in a cloister&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Smirnov enters followed by Luka.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>to Luka</i>]. Fool, you make
too much noise! You're an ass! [<i>Discovering
Mrs. Popov&mdash;politely.</i>] Madam,
I have the honor to introduce myself;
Lieutenant in the Artillery, retired,
country gentleman, Grigorji Stepanovitch
Smirnov! I'm forced to bother you about
an exceedingly important matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>without offering her hand</i>].
What is it you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Your deceased husband,
with whom I had the honor to be acquainted,
left me two notes amounting to
about twelve hundred rubles. Inasmuch
as I have to meet the interest to-morrow
on a loan from the Agrarian Bank, I
should like to request, madam, that you
pay me the money to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Twelve hundred&mdash;and
for what was my husband indebted to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> He had bought oats from
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>with a sigh to Luka</i>].
Don't forget to have Tobby given an
extra measure of oats.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Luka goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>to Smirnov</i>]. If Nikolai
Michailovitch is indebted to you, I will
of course pay you, but, I am sorry, I
haven't the money to-day. To-morrow
my manager will be back from the city
and I shall notify him to pay you what is
due you, but until then I cannot satisfy
your request. Furthermore to-day it is
just seven months since the death of my
husband and I am not in the mood to
discuss money matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> And I am in the mood to
fly up the chimney with my feet in the
air if I can't lay hands on that interest
to-morrow. They'll sequestrate my estate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Day after to-morrow you
will receive the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> I don't need the money day
after to-morrow, I need it to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I'm sorry I can't pay you
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> And I can't wait until day
after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> But what can I do if I
haven't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> So you can't pay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I cannot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Hm.&mdash;Is that your last
word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> My last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Absolutely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Thank you. We shan't forget
it. [<i>He shrugs his shoulders.</i>] And
then they expect me to stand for all that.
The toll gatherer just now met me in the
road and asked, why are you always worrying,
Grigorji Stepanovitch? Why in
heaven's name shouldn't I worry? I need
money, I feel the knife at my throat.
Yesterday morning I left my house in
the early dawn and called on all my
debtors. If even one of them had paid
his debt! I worked the skin off my
fingers! The devil knows in what sort
of Jew-inn I slept, in a room with a barrel
of brandy! And now at last I come
here, seventy versts from home, hope for
a little money and all you give me is
moods. Why shouldn't I worry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I thought I made it plain
to you that my manager will return from
town and then you will get your money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> I did not come to see the
manager, I came to see you. What the
devil&mdash;pardon the language&mdash;do I care
for your manager?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Really, sir, I am neither
used to such language nor such manners.
I shan't listen to you any further. [<i>She
goes out left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> What can one say to that?
Moods! Seven months since her husband
died! And do I have to pay the interest
or not? I repeat the question, have I to
pay the interest or not? Well yes, the
husband is dead and all that, the manager
is&mdash;the devil with him&mdash;traveling
somewhere. Now tell me, what am I to
do? Shall I run away from my creditors
in a balloon? Or push my head into a
stone wall? If I call on Grusdev he
chooses to be "not at home," Iroschevitch
has simply hidden himself, I have
quarreled with Kurzin until I came near
throwing him out of the window, Masutov
is ill and this one in here has&mdash;moods!
Not one of the crew will pay
up! And all because I've spoiled them
all, because I'm an old whiner, an old
dish rag! I'm too tender hearted with
them. But you wait! I'll show you! I
permit nobody to play tricks with me, the
devil with 'em all! I'll stay here and not
budge from the spot until she pays!
Brrr! How angry I am, how terribly
angry I am! Every tendon is trembling
with anger and I can hardly breathe&mdash;ah,
I'm even growing ill. [<i>He calls out.</i>]
Servant!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Luka enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> What is it you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Bring me Kvas or water!
[<i>Luka goes out.</i>] Well, what can we do?
She hasn't it on hand? What sort of logic
is that? A fellow stands with the knife
at his throat, he needs money, he is just
at the point of hanging himself, and she
won't pay because she isn't in the mood
to discuss money matters. See! Pure
woman's logic. That's why I never liked
to talk to women and why I hate to do it
now. I would rather sit on a powder
barrel than talk with a woman. Brr!&mdash;I'm
getting cold as ice, this affair has
made me so angry. I only need to see
such a romantic creature from the distance
to get so angry that I have cramps
in the calves? It's enough to make one
yell for help!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Luka.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka</span> [<i>hands him water</i>]. Madam is
ill and is not receiving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> March! [<i>Luka goes out.</i>]
Ill and isn't receiving! All right, it isn't
necessary. I won't receive either. I'll sit
here and stay until you bring that money.
If you're ill a week, I'll sit here a week.
If you're ill a year, I'll sit here a year.
As heaven is a witness I'll get my money.
You don't disturb me with your mourning&mdash;or
with your dimples. We know
these dimples! [<i>He calls out the window.</i>]
Simon, unharness. We aren't
going to leave right away. I am going
to stay here. Tell them in the stable to
give the horses some oats. The left horse
has twisted the bridle again. [<i>Imitating
him.</i>] Stop. I'll show you how. Stop.
[<i>Leaves window.</i>] It's awful. Unbearable
heat, no money, didn't sleep well last
night and now mourning-dresses with
moods. My head aches, perhaps I ought
to have a drink. Ye-s, I must have a
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'dring'">drink</ins>. [<i>Calling.</i>] Servant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> What do you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> A little drink. [<i>Luka goes
out. Smirnov sits down and looks at his
clothes.</i>] Ugh, a fine figure! No use
denying that. Dust, dirty boots, unwashed,
uncombed, straw on my vest&mdash;the
lady probably took me for a highwayman.
[<i>He yawns.</i>] It was a little
impolite to come into a reception room
with such clothes. Oh well, no harm
done. I'm not here as guest. I'm a creditor.
And there is no special costume
for creditors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka</span> [<i>entering with glass</i>]. You take
a great deal of liberty, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;I just&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Whom are you talking to?
Keep quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Nice mess! This fellow
won't leave! [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Lord, how angry I am!
Angry enough to throw mud at the whole
world! I even feel ill&mdash;servant!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Popov comes in with downcast
eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Sir, in my solitude I have
become unaccustomed to the human voice
and I cannot stand the sound of loud
talking. I beg of you, please to cease
disturbing my quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Pay me my money and I'll
leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I told you once plainly
in your native tongue that I haven't the
money on hand; wait until day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> And I also have the honor
of informing you in your native tongue
that I need the money, not day after to-morrow,
but to-day. If you don't pay
me to-day I shall have to hang myself
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> But what can I do when
I haven't the money? How strange!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> So you are not going to pay
immediately? You're not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Then I'll sit here and stay
until I get the money. [<i>He sits.</i>] You
will pay day after to-morrow? Excellent!
Here I stay until day after to-morrow.
[<i>Jumps up.</i>] I ask you: do I have
to pay that interest to-morrow or not?
Or do you think I'm joking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Sir, I beg of you, don't
scream! This is not a stable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> I'm not asking you about a
stable, I'm asking you whether I have to
pay that interest to-morrow or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> You have no idea how a
lady should be treated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Oh, yes, I know how to treat
ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> No, you don't. You are
an ill-bred, vulgar person&mdash;respectable
people don't speak so with ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Oh, how remarkable! How
do you want one to speak with you? In
French perhaps. Madame, je vous prie&mdash;how
fortunate I am that you won't
pay me my money! Pardon me for having
disturbed you. What beautiful
weather we are having to-day. And how
this mourning becomes you. [<i>He makes
an ironic bow.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Not at all funny&mdash;vulgar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>imitating her</i>]. Not at all
funny&mdash;vulgar. I don't understand how
to behave in the company of ladies.
Madam, in the course of my life I have
seen more women than you have sparrows.
Three times I have fought duels
over women, twelve women I threw over
and nine threw me over. There was a
time when I played the fool, used honeyed
language, bows and scrapings. I loved,
suffered, sighed to the moon, melted in
love's torments. I loved passionately, I
loved to madness, in every key, chattered
like a magpie on emancipation, sacrificed
half my fortune in the tender passion
until now the devil knows I've had enough
of it. Your obedient servant will let you
lead him around by the nose no more.
Enough! Black eyes, passionate eyes,
coral lips, dimples in cheeks, moonlight
whispers, soft, modest sighs,&mdash;for all that,
madam, I wouldn't pay a copper cent.
I am not speaking of the present company
but of women in general; from the tiniest
to the greatest, they are all conceited,
hypocritical, chattering, odious, deceitful
from top to toe; vain, petty, cruel with
a maddening logic and [<i>he strikes his
forehead</i>] in this respect, please excuse
my frankness, but one sparrow is worth
ten of the aforementioned petticoat-philosophers.
When one sees one of the romantic
creatures before him he imagines
that he is looking at some holy being, so
wonderful that its one breath could dissolve
him in a sea of a thousand charms
and delights&mdash;but if one looks into the
soul&mdash;it's nothing but a common crocodile.
[<i>He seizes the arm-chair and breaks
it in two.</i>] But the worst of all is that
this crocodile imagines that it is a chef-d'oeuvre
and that it has a monopoly on
all the tender passions. May the devil
hang me upside down if there is anything
to love about a woman! When she is in
love all she knows is how to complain
and shed tears. If the man suffers and
makes sacrifices she trails her train about
and tries to lead him around by the nose.
You have the misfortune to be a woman
and you naturally know woman's nature;
tell me on your honor, have you ever in
your life seen a woman who was really
true and faithful? You never saw one.
Only the old and the deformed are true
and faithful. It's easier to find a cat
with horns or a white woodcock than a
faithful woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> But just allow me to ask,
who is true and faithful in love? The
man, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Yes, indeed! The man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> The man! [<i>She laughs
ironically.</i>] The man is true and faithful
in love! Well, that is something new.
[<i>She laughs bitterly.</i>] How can you
make such a statement? Men true and
faithful! As long as we have gone as
far as we have I may as well say that of
all the men I have known my husband
was the best&mdash;I loved him passionately
with all my soul, as only a young, sensible
woman may love, I gave him my youth,
my happiness, my fortune, my life. I
worshiped him like a heathen. And
what happened? This best of all men betrayed
me right and left in every possible
fashion. After his death I found his desk
filled with a collection of love letters.
While he was alive he left me alone for
months&mdash;it is horrible to even think
about it&mdash;he made love to other women
in my very presence, he wasted my money
and made fun of my feelings,&mdash;and in
spite of all that I trusted him and was
true to him. And more than that, he is
dead and I am still true to him. I have
buried myself within these four walls and
I shall wear this mourning to my grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>laughing disrespectfully</i>].
Mourning! What on earth do you take
me for? As if I didn't know why you
wore this black domino and why you
buried yourself within these four walls.
As if I didn't know! Such a secret! So
romantic! Some knight will pass the
castle, will gaze up at the windows and
think to himself: "Here dwells the mysterious
Tamara who, for love of her husband,
has buried herself within four
walls." Oh, I understand the art!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>springing up</i>]. What?
What do you mean by saying such things
to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> You have buried yourself
alive, but meanwhile you have not forgotten
to powder your nose!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> How dare you speak to
me so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Don't scream at me, please,
I'm not the manager. Just let me call
things by their right names. I am not a
woman and I am accustomed to speak
out what I think. So please don't scream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I'm not screaming. It is
you who are doing the screaming. Please
leave me, I beg of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Pay me my money and I'll
leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I won't give you the
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> You won't? You won't give
me my money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I don't care what you
do. You won't get a kopeck! Leave
me alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> As I haven't the pleasure of
being either your husband or your fianc&eacute;
please don't make a scene. [<i>He sits
down.</i>] I can't stand it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>breathing hard</i>]. You are
going to sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> I already have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Kindly leave the house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Give me the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I don't care to speak with
impudent men. Leave! [<i>Pause.</i>] You

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Very well. [<i>She rings
the bell.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Luka.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Luka, show the gentleman

Good Lord! [<i>He drops into a chair.</i>]
Oh, I'm ill, I can't breathe!</p>

Dascha! Pelageja! Dascha!
[<i>She rings.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> They're all gone! I'm ill.

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>to Smirnov</i>]. Leave! Get
out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Kindly be a little more polite!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>striking her fists and

You're a boor! A monster!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Wh&mdash;at did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> I said you were a boor, a
monster!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>steps toward her quickly</i>].
Permit me to ask what right you have to
insult me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Yes, I insult you. What
of it? Do you think I am afraid of
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> And you think that because
you are a romantic creature that you can
insult me without being punished? I
challenge you! Now you have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Merciful heaven! Water!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> We'll have a duel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Do you think because you
have big fists and a steer's neck that I am
afraid of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> That is the limit! I allow
no one to insult me and I make no exception
because you are a woman, one
of the "weaker sex"!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>trying to cry him down</i>].
Boor, boor, boor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> It is high time to do away
with the old superstition that it is only
a man who is forced to give satisfaction.
If there is equity at all let there be equity
in all things. There's a limit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> You wish to fight a duel?
Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Immediately. My husband
had pistols. I'll bring them. [<i>She
hurries away, then turns.</i>] Oh, what a
pleasure it will be to put a bullet in
your impudent head. The devil take you!
[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> I'll shoot her down! I'm no
fledgling, no sentimental, young puppy.
For me there is no weaker sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Oh, sir. [<i>Falls to his knees.</i>]
Have mercy on me, an old man, and go
away. You have frightened me to death
already and now you want to fight a duel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>paying no attention</i>]. A
duel. That's equity, that's emancipation.
That way the sexes are made equal. I'll
shoot her down as a matter of principle.
What can a person say to such a woman?
[<i>Imitating her.</i>] "The devil take you.
I'll put a bullet in your impudent head."
What can a person say to that? She was
angry, her eyes blazed, she accepted the
challenge. On my honor it's the first time
in my life that I ever saw such a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> Oh, sir. Go away. Go away
from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> That <i>is</i> a woman. I can understand
her. A real woman. No shilly-shallying,
but fire, powder, and noise! It
would be a pity to shoot a woman like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka</span> [<i>weeping</i>]. Oh, sir; go away.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Mrs. Popov.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Here are the pistols.
But before we have our duel please show
me how to shoot. I have never had a
pistol in my hand before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luka.</span> God be merciful and have pity
upon us! I'll go and get the gardener
and the coachman. Why has this horror
come to us! [<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>looking at the pistols</i>]. You
see there are different kinds of pistols.
There are special duelling pistols with
cap and ball. But these are revolvers,
Smith &amp; Wesson, with ejectors, fine pistols.
A pair like that cost at least ninety
rubles. This is the way to hold a revolver.
[<i>Aside.</i>] Those eyes, those eyes!
A real woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Yes, that way. Then you
pull the hammer back&mdash;so&mdash;then you
aim&mdash;put your head back a little&mdash;just
stretch your arm out, please. So&mdash;then
press your finger on the thing like that,
and that is all. The chief thing is this:
don't get excited, don't hurry your aim,
and take care that your hand doesn't
tremble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> It isn't as well to shoot
inside, let's go into the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Yes. I'll tell you now that
I am going to shoot into the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> That is too much. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Because&mdash;because&mdash;That's
my business why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> You are afraid. Yes.
A-h-h-h. No, no, my dear sir, no welching.
Please follow me. I won't rest myself,
until I've made a hole in your head
that I hate so much. Are you afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Yes, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> You are lying. Why
won't you fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Because&mdash;because&mdash;I&mdash;like
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>with an angry laugh</i>].
You like me! He dares to say that he
likes me. [<i>She points to the door.</i>] Go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>laying the revolver silently
on the table, takes his hat and goes; at the
door he stops a moment gazing at her silently,
then he approaches her undecidedly</i>].
Listen? Are you still angry? I was
mad as the devil, but please understand
me&mdash;how can I express myself?&mdash;The
thing is like this&mdash;such things are&mdash;[<i>He
raises his voice.</i>] How is it my fault that
you owe me money? [<i>Grasps the chair
back which breaks.</i>] The devil knows
what breakable furniture you have! I
like you! Do you understand?&mdash;I&mdash;I'm
almost in love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Leave. I hate you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Lord! What a woman! I
never in my life met one like her. I'm
lost, ruined! I've been caught like a
mouse in a trap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Go, or I'll shoot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Shoot! You have no idea
what happiness it would be to die in sight
of those beautiful eyes, to die from the
revolver in this little velvet hand&mdash;I'm
mad! Consider it and decide immediately
for if I go now; we shall never see each
other again. Decide&mdash;speak&mdash;I am a
noble, a respectable man, have an income
of ten thousand, can shoot a coin thrown
into the air&mdash;I own some fine horses.
Will you be my wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span> [<i>swings the revolver angrily</i>].
Shoot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> My mind is not clear&mdash;I
can't understand&mdash;servant&mdash;water! I
have fallen in love like any young man.
[<i>He takes her hand and she cries with
pain.</i>] I love you! [<i>He kneels.</i>] I love
you as I have never loved before. Twelve
women, I threw over, nine were untrue
to me, but not one of them all have I
loved as I love you. I am conquered,
lost, I lie at your feet like a fool and beg
for your hand. Shame and disgrace!
For five years I haven't been in love, I
thanked the Lord for it and now I am
caught, like a carriage tongue in another
carriage. I beg for your hand! Yes or
no? Will you?&mdash;Good! [<i>He gets up
and goes to the door quickly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Wait a moment&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> [<i>stopping</i>]. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Nothing. You may go.
But&mdash;wait a moment. No, go on, go on.
I hate you. Or no. Don't go. Oh, if
you knew how angry I was, how angry!
[<i>She throws the revolver onto the chair.</i>]
My finger is swollen from this thing.
[<i>She angrily tears her handkerchief.</i>]
What are you standing there for? Get
out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smirnov.</span> Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov.</span> Yes, go. [<i>Cries out.</i>]
What are you going for? Wait&mdash;no, go!!
Oh, how angry I am! Don't come too
near, don't come too near&mdash;er&mdash;come&mdash;no

<p>[<i>Carolina is seated as Zurita enters.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> My friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> My good Zurita, it is so
thoughtful of you to come so promptly!
I shall never be able to repay all your
kindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I am always delighted to be
of service to a friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I asked them to look for
you everywhere. Pardon the inconvenience,
but the emergency was extreme. I
am in a terrible position; all the tact in
the world can never extricate me from
one of those embarrassing predicaments&mdash;unless
you assist me by your advice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Count upon my advice; count
upon me in anything. However, I cannot
believe that you are really in an embarrassing
predicament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But I am, my friend; and
you are the only one who can advise me.
You are a person of taste; your articles
and society column are the standard of
good form with us. Everybody accepts
and respects your decisions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Not invariably, I am sorry to
say&mdash;especially now that I have taken
up the suppression of the hips, which are
fatal to the success of any <i>toilette</i>. Society
was formerly very select in this
city, but it is no longer the same, as you
no doubt have occasion to know. Too
many fortunes have been improvised, too
many aristocratic families have descended
in the scale. There has been a
great change in society. The <i>parvenus</i>
dominate&mdash;and money is so insolent!
People who have it imagine that other
things can be improvised&mdash;as education,
for example, manners, good taste. Surely
you must realize that such things cannot
be improvised. Distinction is a hothouse
plant. We grow too few gardenias nowadays&mdash;like
you, my friend. On the
other hand, we have an abundance of
sow-thistles. Not that I am referring to
the Nu&ntilde;ez family.... How do you suppose
those ladies enliven their Wednesday
evenings? With a gramophone, my
friend, with a gramophone&mdash;just like
any vulgar caf&eacute;; although I must confess
that it is an improvement upon the days
when the youngest sang, the middle one
recited, and all played together. Nevertheless
it is horrible. You can imagine
my distress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> You know, of course, that
I never take part in their Wednesdays.
I never call unless I am sure they are not
at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> But that is no longer a protection;
they leave the gramophone. And
the maid invites you to wait and entertain
yourself with the <i>Mochuelo</i>. What
is a man to do? It is impossible to resent
the records upon the maid. But we
are wandering from the subject. You
excite my curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> You know that to-morrow
is the day of the unveiling of the statue
of my husband, of my previous husband&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> A fitting honor to the memory
of that great, that illustrious man.
This province owes him much, and so does
all Spain. We who enjoyed the privilege
of calling ourselves his friends, should be
delighted to see justice done to his deserts
at last, here where political jealousies
and intrigues have always belittled the
achievements of our eminent men. But
Don Patricio Molinete could have no enemies.
To-morrow will atone for much of
the pettiness of the past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No doubt. I feel I ought
to be proud and happy, although you
understand the delicacy of my position.
Now that I have married again, my
name is not the same. Yet it is impossible
to ignore the fact that once it was
mine, especially as everybody knows that
we were a model couple. I might perhaps
have avoided the situation by leaving
town for a few days on account of
my health, but then that might have been
misinterpreted. People might have
thought that I was displeased, or that I
declined to participate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Assuredly. Although your
name is no longer the same, owing to circumstances,
the force of which we appreciate,
that is no reason why you
should be deprived of the honor of having
borne it worthily at the time. Your
present husband has no right to take
offense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No, poor Florencio! In
fact, he was the first to realize that I
ought to take a leading part in the rejoicing.
Poor Florencio was always poor
Patricio's greatest admirer. Their political
ideas were the same; they agreed
in everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Apparently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> As I have reason to know.
Poor Patricio loved me dearly; perhaps
that was what led poor Florencio to imagine
that there was something in me to
justify the affection of that great-hearted
and intellectual man. It was enough for
me to know that Florencio was Patricio's
most intimate friend in order to form my
opinion of him. Of course, I recognize
that Florencio's gifts will never enable
him to shine so brilliantly, but that is not
to say that he is wanting in ability. He
lacks ambition, that is all. All his desires
are satisfied at home with me, at his
own fireside. And I am as well pleased
to have it so. I am not ambitious myself.
The seasons which I spent with my
husband in Madrid were a source of great
uneasiness to me. I passed the week during
which he was Minister of Agriculture
in one continual state of anxiety. Twice
he nearly had a duel&mdash;over some political
question. I did not know which way
to turn. If he had ever become Prime
Minister, as was actually predicted by a
newspaper which he controlled, I should
have been obliged to take to my bed for
the week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> You are not like our senator's
wife, Se&ntilde;ora Espinosa, nor the wife of
our present mayor. They will never
rest, nor allow others to do so, until
they see their husbands erected in
marble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Do you think that either
Espinosa or the mayor are of a caliber
to deserve statues?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Not publicly, perhaps. In a
private chapel, in the class of martyrs
and husbands, it might not be inappropriate.
But I am growing impatient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> As you say, friend Zurita,
it might seem marked for me to leave
the city. Yet if I remain I must attend
the unveiling of the monument to my poor
Patricio; I must be present at the memorial
exercises to-night in his honor; I
must receive the delegations from Madrid
and the other cities, as well as the committees
from the rest of the province.
But what attitude ought I to assume? If
I seem too sad, nobody will believe that
my feeling is sincere. On the other hand,
it would not be proper to appear altogether
reconciled. Then people would
think that I had forgotten too quickly.
In fact, they think so already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Oh, no! You were very young
when you became a widow. Life was
just beginning for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> It is a delicate matter,
however, to explain to my sisters-in-law.
Tell me, what ought I to wear? Anything
severe, an attempt at mourning,
would be ridiculous, since I am going
with my husband; on the other hand, I
should not like to suggest a festive spirit.
What do you think, friend Zurita? Give
me your advice. What would you wear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> It is hard to say; the problem
is difficult. Something rich and black,
perhaps, relieved by a note of violet.
The unveiling of a monument to perpetuate
the memory of a great man is not an
occasion for mourning. Your husband
is partaking already of the joys of immortality,
in which no doubt, he anticipates
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Do not thank me. You have
done enough. You have been faithful to
his memory. You have married again,
but you have married a man who was
your husband's most intimate friend.
You have not acted like other widows
of my acquaintance&mdash;Se&ntilde;ora Benitez,
for example. She has been living for
two years with the deadliest enemy her
husband had in the province, without
any pretense at getting married&mdash;which
in her case would have been preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> There is no comparison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> No, my friend; everybody
sympathizes with your position, as they
ought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> The only ones who worry
me are my sisters-in-law. They insist
that my position is ridiculous, and that
of my husband still more so. They do
not see how we can have the effrontery
to present ourselves before the statue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Se&ntilde;ora, I should not hesitate
though it were that of the Commander.
Your sisters-in-law exaggerate. Your
present husband is the only one you have
to consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I have no misgivings upon
that score. I know that both will appreciate
that my feelings are sincere, one
in this world, and the other from the
next. As for the rest, the rest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> The rest are your friends and
your second husband's friends, as we were
of the first. We shall all take your part.
The others you can afford to neglect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Thanks for those words of
comfort. I knew that you were a good
friend of ours, as you were also of his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> A friend to both, to all three;
<i>si</i>, <i>se&ntilde;ora</i>, to all three. But here is your
husband.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Don Florencio enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Don Florencio! My friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> My dear Zurita! I am delighted
to see you! I wish to thank you
for that charming article in memory of
our never-to-be-forgotten friend. It was
good of you, and I appreciate it. You
have certainly proved yourself an excellent
friend of his. Thanks, my dear Zurita,
thanks! Carolina and I are both
indebted to you for your charming article.
It brought tears to our eyes. Am
I right, Carolina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> We were tremendously affected
by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Friend Zurita, I am deeply
gratified. For the first time in the history
of the province, all parties have
united to do honor to this region's most
eminent son. But have you seen the
monument? It is a work of art. The
statue is a perfect likeness&mdash;it is the
man, the man himself! The allegorical
features are wonderfully artistic&mdash;Commerce,
Industry, and Truth taken altogether
in the nude. Nothing finer could
be wished. You can imagine the trouble,
however, we had with the nudes. The
conservative element opposed the nudes,
but the sculptor declined to proceed if
the nudes were suppressed. In the end
we won a decisive victory for Art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Do you know, I think it
would have been just as well not to have
had any nudes? What was the use of
offending anybody? Several of our
friends are going to remain away from
the ceremonies upon that account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> How ridiculous! That
only shows how far we are behind the
times. You certainly have no feeling of
that sort after having been the companion
of that great, that liberal man. I remember
the trip we took to Italy together&mdash;you
surely recollect it, Carolina. I
never saw a man so struck with admiration
at those marvelous monuments of
pagan and Renaissance art. Oh, what a
man! What a wonderful man! He was
an artist. Ah! Before I forget it, Carolina,
Guti&eacute;rrez asked me for any pictures
you have for the special edition of his
paper, and I should like to have him publish
the verses which he wrote you when
you were first engaged. Did you ever see
those verses? That man might have been
a poet&mdash;he might have been anything
else for that matter. Talk about letters!
I wish you could see his letters. Carolina,
let us see some of those letters he
wrote you when you were engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Not now. That is hardly
the time....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Naturally. In spite of
the satisfaction which we feel, these are
trying days for us. We are united by
our memories. I fear I shall never be
able to control myself at the unveiling
of the statue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio, for heaven's
sake, you must! You must control yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Yes, do control yourself. You
must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I am controlling myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> If there is nothing further
that I can do....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No, thank you, Zurita. I
am awfully obliged to you. Now that I
know what I am to wear, the situation
does not seem half so embarrassing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I understand. A woman's
position is never so embarrassing as when
she is hesitating as to what to put on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Until to-morrow then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Don Florencio!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Thank you again for your
charming article. It was admirable!
Admirable!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Zurita retires.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I see that you feel it
deeply! you are touched. So am I. It
is foolish to attempt to conceal it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I don't know how to express
it, but&mdash;I am upset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Don't forget the pictures,
however, especially the one where the
three of us were taken together on the
second platform of the Eiffel tower. It
was particularly good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, something out of the
ordinary. Don't you think, perhaps, that
our private affairs, our family life....
How do we know whether at this time,
in our situation....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What are you afraid of?
That is the woman of it. How narrow-minded!
You ought to be above such
pettiness after having been the wife of
such an intelligent man. Every detail
of the private life of the great has its
interest for history. Those of us who
knew him, who in a certain sense were his
colaborers&mdash;you will not accuse me of
immodesty&mdash;his colaborers in the great
work of his life, owe it to history to see
that the truth be known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Nevertheless I hardly think
I would print those letters&mdash;much less
the verses. Do you remember what they
said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Of course, I remember:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Like a moth on a pin I preserve all your kisses!..."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Everybody makes allowances for poetry.
Nobody is going to take seriously what
he reads in a poem. He married you
anyway. Why should any one object?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Stop, Florencio! What are
you talking about? We are making ourselves
ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Why should we make ourselves
ridiculous? Although I shall certainly
stand by you, whatever you decide,
if for no other reason than that I
am your husband, his widow's husband.
Otherwise people might think that I
wanted you to forget, that I was jealous
of his memory; and you know that is not
the case. You know how I admired him,
how I loved him&mdash;just as he did me.
Nobody could get along with him as well
as I could; he was not easy to get along
with, I do not need to tell you that. He
had his peculiarities&mdash;they were the peculiarities
of a great man&mdash;but they were
great peculiarities. Like all great men,
he had an exaggerated opinion of himself.
He was horribly stubborn, like all
strong characters. Whenever he got on
one of his hobbies no power on earth
could pry him off of it. It is only out
of respect that I do not say he was pig-headed.
I was the only one who had the
tact and the patience to do anything with
him; you know that well enough. How
often you said to me: "Oh, Florencio!
I can't stand it any longer!" And then
I would reason with you and talk to him,
and every time that you had a quarrel
I was the one who consoled you afterward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio, you are perfectly
disgusting! You have no right to
talk like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Very well then, my dear.
I understand how you feel. This is a
time when everybody is dwelling on his
virtues, his good qualities, but I want you
to remember that that great man had also
his faults.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> You don't know what you
are talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Compare me with him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio? You know that
in my mind there has never been any
comparison. Comparisons are odious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Not necessarily. But of
course you have not! You have never
regretted giving up his distinguished
name, have you, Carolina, for this humble
one of mine? Only I want you to understand
that if I had desired to shine,
if I had been ambitious.... I have talent
myself. Now admit it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Of course I do, my dear, of
course! But what is the use of talking
nonsense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What is the matter with
you, anyway? You are nervous to-day.
It is impossible to conduct a sensible conversation.&mdash;Hello!
Your sisters-in-law!
I am not at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Don't excite yourself.
They never ask for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I am delighted!... Well,
I wish you a short session and escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I am in a fine humor for
this sort of thing myself.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Florencio goes out. Eudosia and
Paquita enter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> I trust that we do not intrude?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> How can you ask? Come
right in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> It seems we find you at home
for once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> So it seems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Strange to say, whenever
we call you always appear to be out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> A coincidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> The coincidence is to find
you at home. [<i>A pause.</i>] We passed
your husband on the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Are you sure that you
would recognize him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Oh! he was not alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Paquita saw him with Somolino's
wife, at Sanchez the confectioner's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Very possibly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> I should not make light of
it, if I were you. You know what Somolino's
wife is, to say nothing of Sanchez
the confectioner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I didn't know about the
confectioner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> No respectable woman, no
woman who even pretends to be respectable,
would set foot in his shop since he
married that French girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I didn't know about the
French girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Yes, he married her&mdash;I say
married her to avoid using another term.
He married her in Bayonne&mdash;if you call
such a thing marriage&mdash;civilly, which is
the way French people marry. It is a
land of perdition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I am very sorry to hear it
because I am awfully fond of sweetmeats.
I adore <i>bonbons</i> and <i>marrons glac&eacute;s</i>, and
nobody here has as good ones as Sanchez,
nor anywhere else for that matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> In that case you had as well
deny yourself, unless you are prepared
to invite criticism. Somolino's wife is
the only woman who enters the shop and
faces the French girl, who gave her a
receipt for dyeing her hair on the spot.
You must have noticed how she is doing
it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I hadn't noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> It is not jet-black any more;
it is baby-pink&mdash;so she is having the
Frenchwoman manicure her nails twice
a week. Have you noticed the condition
of her nails? They are the talk of the
town.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Well, I trust he is satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> I do not call him your husband.
Oh, our poor, dear brother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I have not the slightest
idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> So he has had his way at last
and desecrated the statue of our poor
brother with the figures of those naked
women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> As large as life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But Florencio is not responsible.
It was the sculptor and the
committee. I cannot see anything objectionable
in them myself. There are such
figures on all monuments. They are allegorical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> I could understand, perhaps,
why the statue of Truth should be unclothed.
Something of the sort was always
expected of Truth. But I must say
that Commerce and Industry might have
had a tunic at least. Commerce, in my
opinion, is particularly indecent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> We have declined the seats
which were reserved for us. They were
directly in front and you could see everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> I suppose you still intend to
be present? What a pity that there is
nobody to give you proper advice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> As I have been invited,
I judge that I shall be welcome as I
am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Possibly&mdash;if it were good
form for you to appear at all. But when
you exhibit yourself with that man&mdash;who
was his best friend&mdash;after only
three short years!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Three long years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> No doubt they seemed long
to you. Three years, did I say? They
were like days to us who still keep his
memory green!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Who still bear his name, because
no other name sounds so noble in
our ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Rather than change it, we
have declined very flattering proposals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I am afraid that you have
made a mistake. You remember that
your brother was very anxious to see
you married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> He imagined that all men
were like him, and deserved wives like
us, our poor, dear brother! Who would
ever have dreamed he could have been
forgotten so soon? Fancy his emotions
as he looks down on you from the skies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I do not believe for one
moment that he has any regrets. If he
had, then what would be the use of being
in paradise? Don't you worry about me.
The best thing that a young widow can
do is marry at once. I was a very young
widow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> You were twenty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Twenty-six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> We concede you twenty-six.
At all events, you were not a child&mdash;not
to speak of the fact that no widow
can be said to be a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No more than a single
woman can be said to be old. However,
I fail to see that there would be any
impropriety in my being present at the
unveiling of the statue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Do you realize that the premature
death of your husband will be the
subject of all the speakers? They will
dwell on the bereavement which we have
suffered through the loss of such an eminent
man. How do you propose to take
it? When people see you standing there,
complacent and satisfied, alongside of
that man, do you suppose they will ever
believe that you are not reconciled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> What will your husband do
while they are extolling the genius of
our brother, and he knows that he never
had any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> That was not your brother's
opinion. He thought very highly of
Florencio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Very highly. Our poor, dear
brother! Among his other abilities he
certainly had an extraordinary aptitude
for allowing himself to be deceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> That assumption is offensive
to me; it is unfair to all of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> I hope you brought it with
you, Paquita?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Yes; here it is.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Taking out a book.</i>]</p>

Why, thanks&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> No, do not thank us. Read,
read what our poor brother has written
to the author of this book, who was one
of his intimate friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Recaredo Casalonga. Ah!
I remember&mdash;a rascal we were obliged
to turn out of the house. Do you mean
to say that scamp Casalonga has any
letters? Merely to hear the name makes
me nervous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> But go on! Page two hundred
and fourteen. Is that the page,
Paquita?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> It begins on page two hundred
and fourteen, but before it amounts
to anything turn the page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Quick, quick! Let me see.
What does he say? What are these letters?
What is this? He says that I.... But
there is not a word of truth in
it. My husband could never have written
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> But there it is in cold type.
You don't suppose they would dare to
print&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But this is outrageous;
this book is a libel. It invades the private
life&mdash;the most private part of it!
It must be stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> It cannot be stopped. You
will soon see whether or not it can be
stopped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Probably the edition is exhausted
by this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Is that so? We shall see!
We shall see!&mdash;Florencio! Florencio!
Come quickly! Florencio!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Perhaps he has not yet returned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> He seemed to be enjoying
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Nonsense! He was never
out of the house. You are two old busybodies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Carolina! You said that
without thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> I cannot believe my ears.
Did you say busybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> That is exactly what I said.
Now leave me alone. I can't stand it. It
is all your fault. You are insupportable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia</span> and <span class="smcap">Paquita</span>. Carolina!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What is it, my dear?
What is the matter? Ah! You? I am
delighted....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Yes, we! And we are leaving

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Where we have been called

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Where we have been told

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> And when people say such
things you can imagine what they think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> But Eudosia, Paquita....
I do not understand. As far as I
am concerned....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> The person who is now your
wife will make her explanations to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> I never expected to be driven
out of our brother's house like this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> Our poor, dear brother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> But, Carolina&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Let them go! Let them
go! They are impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Did you hear that, Eudosia?
We are impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> I heard it, Paquita. There
is nothing left for us to hear in this
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes there is! You are as
impossible as all old maids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eudosia.</span> There was something for us

<p><span class="smcap">Paquita.</span> Come, Eudosia.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They go out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What is this trouble between
you and your sisters-in-law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> There isn't any trouble.
We were arguing, that was all. There is
nothing those women like so much as
gossip, or making themselves disagreeable
in any way they can. Do you remember
Casalonga?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Recaredo Casalonga? I
should say I did remember him! That
man was a character, and strange to say,
a profound philosopher with it all. He
was quite a humorist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, he was. Well, this
philosopher, this humorist, has conceived
the terribly humorous idea of publishing
this book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Let me see. "Don Patricio
Molinete, the Man and His Work.
A Biography. Together with His Correspondence
and an Estimate of His
Life." A capital idea! They were great
friends, you know, although I don't suppose
that there can be anything particular
in this book. What could Casalonga
tell us anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Us? Nothing. But go on,
go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> You don't say! Letters
of Patricio's. Addressed to whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> To the author of the book,
so it seems. Personal letters, they are
confidential. Go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> "Dear Friend: Life is sad.
Perhaps you ask the cause of my disillusionment.
How is it that I have lost
my faith in the future, in the future of
our unfortunate land?" I remember that
time. He was already ill. This letter
was written after he had liver complaint
and took a dark view of everything. Ah!
What a pity that great men should be
subject to such infirmities! Think of the
intellect being made the slave of the
liver! We are but dust. "The future
of this unfortunate land...."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No, that doesn't amount to
anything. Lower down, lower down.
Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> "Life is sad!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Are you beginning all over
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, he repeats himself.
What is this? "I never loved but once
in my life; I never loved but one woman&mdash;my
wife." He means you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span>. Yes. Go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio</span> "I never trusted but one
friend, my friend Florencio." He means
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, yes; he means you.
But go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I wonder what he can be
driving at. Ah! What does he say?
That you, that I....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Go on, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> "This woman and this
man, the two greatest, the two pure, the
two unselfish passions of my life, in whom
my very being was consumed&mdash;how can
I bring myself to confess it? I hardly
dare admit it to myself! They are in
love&mdash;they love each other madly&mdash;in
secret&mdash;perhaps without even suspecting
themselves."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> What do you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span>  Suspecting  themselves....
"They are struggling to overcome
their guilty passion, but how long will
they continue to struggle? Yet I am
sorry for them both. What ought I to
do? I cannot sleep."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Impossible! He never
wrote such letters. Besides, if he did,
they ought never to have been published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But true or false, they
have been published, and here they are.
Ah! But this is nothing! You ought to
see what he says farther on. He goes on
communicating his observations, and
there are some, to be perfectly frank,
which nobody could have made but himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> You don't mean to tell me
that you think these letters are genuine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> They might be for all we
know. He gives dates and details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> And all the time we
thought he suspected nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> You do jump so at conclusions,
Florencio. How could he suspect?
You know how careful we were about
everything, no matter what happened, so
as not to hurt his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> This only goes to show all
the good that it did us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> He could only suspect&mdash;that
it was the truth; that we were loving
in silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Then perhaps you can explain
to me what was the use of all this
silence? Don't you see that what he has
done now is to go and blurt the whole
thing out to this rascal Casalonga?&mdash;an
unscrupulous knave whose only interest
in the matter is to turn these confidences
to his own advantage! It is useless to
attempt to defend it. Such foolishness
was unpardonable. I should never have
believed it of my friend. If he had any
doubts about me&mdash;about us&mdash;why didn't
he say so? Then we could have been
more careful, and have done something to
ease his mind. But this notion of running
and telling the first person who happens
along.... What a position does it
leave me in? In what light do we appear
at this time? Now, when everybody
is paying respect to his memory, and I
have put myself to all this trouble in
order to raise money for this monument&mdash;what
are people going to think when
they read these things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I always said that we would
have trouble with that monument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> How shall I have the face
to present myself to-morrow before the
monument?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> My sisters-in-law were
right. We are going to be conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Ah! But this must be
stopped. I shall run at once to the
offices of the papers, to the judicial authorities,
to the governor, to all the booksellers.
As for this Casalonga&mdash;Ah!
I will settle with him! Either he will retract
and confess that these letters are
forgeries from beginning to end, or I will
kill him! I will fight with him in
earnest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio! Don't forget
yourself! You are going too far. You
don't mean a duel? To expose your life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Don't you see that it is impossible
to submit to such an indignity?
Where is this thing going to stop? Is
nobody's private life to be secure? And
this goes deeper than the private life&mdash;it
impugns the sanctity of our intentions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No, Florencio!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Let me go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio! Anything but
a duel! No, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Ah! Either he will retract
and withdraw the edition of this libel or,
should he refuse....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Zurita!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Zurita enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Don Florencio.... Carolina....
Don't say a word! I know
how you feel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Did you see it? Did you
hear it? Is this a civilized country in
which we live?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But surely he has not heard
it already?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Yes, at the Club. Some one
had the book; they were passing it around....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> At the Club?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Don't be alarmed. Everybody
thinks it is blackmail&mdash;a case of
<i>chantage</i>. Don Patricio could never have
written such letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Ah! So they think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Even if he had, they deal with
private matters, which ought never to
have been made public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Exactly my idea&mdash;with
private matters; they are confidential.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I lost no time, as you may be
sure, of hurrying to Valdivieso's shop,
where the books are on sale. I found
him amazed; he was entirely innocent.
He bought the copies supposing that the
subject was of timely importance; that it
was of a serious nature. He hurried at
once to withdraw the copies from the
window, and ran in search of the author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Of the author? Is the author
in town?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Yes, he came with the books;
he arrived with them this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Ah! So this scamp Casalonga
is here, is he? Tell me where I
can find him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> At the Hotel de Europa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio! Don't you go!
Hold him back! He means to challenge
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Never! It is not worth the
trouble. Besides, you ought to hold yourself
above such things. Your wife is
above them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> But what will people say,
friend Zurita? What will people say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Everybody thinks it is a huge
joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> A joke? Then our position
is ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I did not say that. What I
do say....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, no, friend Zurita; you
are a man of honor, you know that it is
necessary for me to kill this man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But suppose he is the one
who kills you? No, Florencio, not a duel!
What is the use of the courts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, I prefer to fight. My
dear Zurita, run in search of another
friend and stop at the Hotel de Europa
as my representatives. Seek out this
man, exact reparation upon the spot&mdash;a
reparation which shall be resounding,
complete. Either he declares over his
own signature that those letters are impudent
forgeries or, should he refuse....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Florencio!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Stop at nothing! Do not
haggle over terms. Let it be pistols with
real bullets, as we pace forward each to
each!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> But, Don Florencio!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina</span>. Don't go, I beg of you!
Don't leave the house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No, he will never go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> But, Don Florencio! Consider.... The
situation is serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> When a man is made ridiculous
the situation ceases to be serious!
How shall I have the face to show myself
before the monument! I&mdash;his most
intimate friend! She, my wife, his
widow! And everybody thinking all the
while of those letters, imagining that I,
that she.... No, no! Run! Bring me

you; to offer a thousand explanations.</p>

is possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Consider a moment. In my

He appears to be innocent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Of the first instincts of a
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Exactly. I did not venture
to put it so plainly. He attaches no importance
to the affair whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Of course not! It is nothing

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I always knew you were
innocent! but this person....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Come, come now! Don't
blame it on me. How the devil was I to
know that you were here&mdash;and married
to his widow! Sport for the gods!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Do you hear what he says?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I told you that he appeared
to be innocent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> And I told you that he
was devoid of the first instincts of a
gentleman; although I failed to realize
to what an extent. Sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Don't be absurd! Stop
making faces at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> In the first place, I don't
recall that we were ever so intimate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Of course we were! Of
course! Anyhow, what difference does
it make? We were together for a whole
season; we were inseparable. Hard times
those for us both! But what did we
care? When one of us was out of money,
all he had to do was to ask the other,
and be satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Yes; I seem to recall that
the other was always I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Ha, ha, ha! That might
be. Stranger things have happened. But
you are not angry with me, are you?
The thing is not worth all this fuss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Do you hear what he says?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> You may be sure that if
I had had the slightest idea.... I
bought the books so as to take advantage
of the timeliness of the monument. If I
had ever suspected....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Identically my position&mdash;to
take advantage of the monument.
Life is hard. While the conservatives
are in power, I am reduced to extremities.
I am at my wit's end to earn an honest
penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I admire your colossal impudence.
What are you going to do with
a man like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Exactly the question that occurred
to me. What are you going to
do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> For a time I was reduced
to writing plays&mdash;like everybody else&mdash;although
mine were better. That was
the reason they did not succeed. Then
I married my last landlady; I was obliged
to settle with her somehow. A little difference
arose between us, so we agreed
to separate amicably after smashing all
the furniture. However, that will be of
no interest to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, no, it is of no interest
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> A novel, my boy! A veritable
work of romance! I wandered all
over the country explaining views for
the cinematograph. You know what a
gift I have for talk? Wherever I appeared
the picture houses were crowded&mdash;even
to the exits. Then my voice gave
out. I was obliged to find some other
outlet for my activities. I thought of
my friends. You know what friends are;
as soon as a man needs them he hasn't
any friends. Which way was I to turn?
I happened to hear that you were unveiling
a monument to the memory of
friend Patricio. Poor Patricio! That
man was a friend! He could always be
relied upon. It occurred to me that I
might write out a few pages of reminiscences&mdash;preferably
something personal&mdash;and
publish any letters of his which I
had chanced to preserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What luck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Pshaw! Bread and butter&mdash;bread
and butter, man! A mere
pittance. It occurred to me that they
would sell better here than anywhere else&mdash;this
is where he lived. So I came this
morning third class&mdash;think of that, third
class!&mdash;and hurried at once to this fellow's
shop. I placed two thousand copies
with him, which he took from me at a horrible
discount. You know what these
booksellers are....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> I call you to witness&mdash;what
was customary under the circumstances.
He was selling for cash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Am I the man to deny it?
You can divide mankind into two classes&mdash;knaves
and fools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Listen to this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You are not one of the
fools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> I protest! How am I to
profit by the transaction? Do you suppose
that I shall sell a single copy of
this libel now that I know that it is offensive
to my particular, my excellent friend,
Don Florencio, and to his respected wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Thanks, friend Valdivieso,
thanks for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> I shall burn the edition,
although you can imagine what that will
cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> The loss will be mine. It
will be at my expense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> What did I tell you?
Florencio will pay. What are you complaining
about?&mdash;If I were in your place,
though, I'd be hanged if I would give the
man one penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span>  What? When you have
collected spot cash?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You don't call that collecting?
Not at that discount. The
paper was worth more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> The impudence of the
thing was worth more than the paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Ha, ha, ha! Really, I
cannot find it in my heart to be angry
with you. You are too clever! But what
was I to do? I had to find some outlet
for my activities. Are you going to kill
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I have made my arrangements.
Do you suppose that I will submit
meekly to such an indignity? If
you refuse to fight, I will hale you before
the courts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Drop that tragic tone. A
duel? Between us? Over what? Because
the wife of a friend&mdash;who at the
same time happens to be your wife&mdash;has
been intimate with you? Suppose it had
been with some one else!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> The supposition is improper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You are the first man I
ever heard of who was offended because
it was said that he had been intimate
with his wife. The thing is preposterous.
How are we ever going to fight over
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I can see his point of view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Patricio could never have
written those letters, much less to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Talk as much as you like,
the letters are genuine. Although it may
have been foolish of Patricio to have
written them&mdash;that is a debatable question.
I published them so as to enliven
the book. A little harmless suggestion&mdash;people
look for it; it adds spice. Aside
from that, what motive could I have had
for dragging you into it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I admire your frankness
at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> What do you propose to do
with this man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What do you propose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You know I was always
fond of you. You are a man of ability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You have more ability
than Patricio had. He was a worthy
soul, no doubt, but between us, who were
in the secret, an utter blockhead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Hardly that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> I need not tell you what
reputations amount to in this country. If
he had had your brains, your transcendent
ability....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> How can I stop this man
from talking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You have always been too
modest in my opinion; you have remained
in the background in order to give him
a chance to shine, to attract attention.
Everybody knows that his best speeches
were written by you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence.</span> You have no right to betray
my confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Yes, gentlemen, it is only
just that you should know. The real
brains belonged to this man, he is the
one who should have had the statue. As
a friend he is wonderful, unique!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> How am I going to fight
with this man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> I will give out a statement
at once&mdash;for public consumption&mdash;declaring
that the letters are forgeries&mdash;or
whatever you think best; as it appeals
to you. Fix it up for yourself. It is of
no consequence anyhow. I am above this
sort of thing. I should be sorry, however,
to see this fellow receive more than
his due, which is two <i>reals</i> a copy, or
what he paid me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> I cannot permit you to
meddle in my affairs. You are a rogue
and a cheat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> A rogue and a cheat? In
that case you are the one I will fight with.
You are no friend of mine. You are an
exploiter of other men's brains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> You are willing to fight
with me, are you&mdash;a respectable man,
the father of a family? After swindling
me out of my money!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Swindling? That is no
language to use in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> I use it where I like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Gentlemen, gentlemen!
This is my house, this is the house of my
wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Valdivieso!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga</span> [<i>to Florencio</i>]. I choose
you for my second. And you too, my
friend&mdash;what is your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> But will you listen to
him? Do you suppose that I will fight
with this rascal, with the first knave who
happens along? I, the father of a family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> I cannot accept your explanation.
My friends will confer with
yours and apprise us as to the details.
Have everything ready for this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Do you stand here and
sanction this nonsense? You cannot believe
one word that he says. No doubt
it would be convenient for you to retire
and use me as a Turk's head to receive
all the blows, when you are the one who
ought to fight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Friend Valdivieso, I cannot
permit reflections upon my conduct
from you. After all, you need not have
purchased the book, which you did for
money, knowing that it was improper,
since it contained matter which was offensive
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Are you speaking in earnest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I was never more in earnest
in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Yes, sir, and it is high
time for us all to realize that it is in
earnest. It was all your fault. Nobody
buys without spending the wares. It was
your business to have pointed out to me
the indiscretion I was about to commit.
[<i>To Florencio.</i>] I am perfectly willing
to withdraw if you wish to fight him, to
yield my place as the aggrieved party
to you. I should be delighted to act as
one of your seconds, with our good friend
here&mdash;what is your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Zurita.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> My good friend Zurita.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Am I losing my mind?
This is a trap which you have set for me,
a despicable trap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Friend Valdivieso, I cannot
tolerate these reflections. I am incapable
of setting a trap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Ah! And so am I! When you
entered this house you were familiar
with its reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You have forgotten with
whom you are speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Nonsense! This is too
much. I wash my hands of the whole
business. Is this the spirit in which my
advances are received? What I will do
now is sell the book&mdash;and if I can't sell
it, I will give it away! Everybody can
read it then&mdash;and they can talk as much
as they want to. This is the end! I am
through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Wait? What was that?
I warn you not to sell so much as one
copy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> I should be sorry if you did.
Take care not to drag me into it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Nor me either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valdivieso.</span> Enough! Do as you see
fit&mdash;and I shall do the same. This is
the end&mdash;the absolute end! It is the
finish!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Rushes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Stop him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> It won't be necessary. I
shall go to the shop and take back the
edition. Whatever you intended to pay
him you can hand directly to me. I am
your friend; besides I need the money.
This man shall not get the best of me.
Oh! By the way, what are you doing to-night?
Have dinner with me. I shall
expect you at the hotel. Don't forget!
If you don't show up, I may drop in myself
and have dinner with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No! What would my wife
say? She has trouble enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Nonsense! She knows me,
and we should have a good laugh. Is she
as charming, as good-looking, as striking
as ever? I am keen for her. I don't
need to ask whether she is happy. Poor
Patricio was a character! What a sight
he was! What a figure! And age doubled
him for good measure. I'll look in
on you later. It has been a rare pleasure
this time. There are few friends
like you. Come, shake hands! I am
touched; you know how it is. See you
later! If I don't come back, I have killed
my man and am in jail for it. Tell your
wife. If I can help out in any way....
Good-by, my friend&mdash;ah, yes!
Zurita. I have a terrible head to-day.
See you later!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Did you ever see anything
equal of it? I never did, and I knew
him of old. But he has made progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> His assurance is fairly epic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What are you going to do
with a man who takes it like this? You
cannot kill him in cold blood&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Carolina re&euml;nters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Ah! Carolina! Were you
listening? You heard everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, and in spite of it I
think he is fascinating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Since Carolina feels that
way it simplifies the situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Why not? She heard the compliments.
The man is irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Carolina, it comes simply
to this: nobody attaches any importance
to the matter. Only two or three copies
have been sold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, but one of them was
to my sisters-in-law, which is the same
as if they had sold forty thousand. They
will tell everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> They were doing it anyhow;
there is no further cause for worry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> At all events, I shall not attend
the unveiling to-morrow, and you
ought not to go either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> But, wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Ah! The unveiling.... I
had forgotten to mention it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> To mention what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> It has been postponed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> The committee became nervous
at the last moment over the protests
against the nudes. After seeing
the photographs many ladies declined to
participate. At last the sculptor was
convinced, and he has consented to withdraw
the statue of Truth altogether, and
to put a tunic upon Industry, while Commerce
is to have a bathing-suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> That will be splendid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> All this, however, will require
several days, and by that time everything
will have been forgotten.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Casalonga re&euml;nters with the books.
He is completely out of breath and
drops them suddenly upon the
floor, where they raise a tremendous
cloud of dust.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> <i>Ay!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> I had you scared! At
your service.... Here is the entire edition.
I returned him his thousand pesetas&mdash;I
declined to make it another penny.
I told you that would be all that was
necessary. I am a man of my word.
Now it is up to you. No more could be
asked! I am your friend and have said
enough. I shall have to find some other
outlet for my activities. That will be
all for to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> I will give you two thousand
pesetas. But beware of a second
edition!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Don't begin to worry so
soon. With this money I shall have
enough to be decent at least&mdash;at least
for two months. You know me, se&ntilde;ora.
I am Florencio's most intimate friend, as
I was Patricio's most intimate friend,
which is to say one of the most intimate
friends you ever had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> Yes, I remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> But I have changed since
that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Not a bit of it! He is
just the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Yes, the change is in you.
You are the same, only you have improved.
[<i>To Carolina.</i>] I am amazed
at the opulence of your beauty, which a
fortunate marriage has greatly enhanced.
Have you any children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> No....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> You are going to have
some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Flatterer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> But I must leave before
night: there is nothing for me to do here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, you have attended to
everything. I shall send it after you to
the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> Add a little while you are
about it to cover expenses&mdash;by way of a
finishing touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Oh, very well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> That will be all. Se&ntilde;ora,
if I can be of service.... My good
Zurita! Friend Florencio! Before I
die I hope to see you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Yes! Unless I die first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> I know how you feel.
You take the worst end for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Allow me that consolation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casalonga.</span> God be with you, my
friend. Adios! Rest in peace. How
different are our fates! Life to you is
sweet. You have everything&mdash;love,
riches, satisfaction. While I&mdash;I laugh
through my tears!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> That cost you money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> What else did you expect?
I gave up to avoid a scandal upon your
account. I could see that you were nervous.
I would have fought if I could
have had my way; I would have carried
matters to the last extreme. Zurita will
tell you so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> I always said that monument
would cost us dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> Obviously! Two thousand
pesetas now, besides the twenty-five thousand
which I subscribed for the monument,
to say nothing of my uniform as
Chief of Staff which I had ordered for
the unveiling. Then there are the banquets
to the delegates....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zurita.</span> Glory is always more expensive
than it is worth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> It is not safe to be famous
even at second hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carolina.</span> But you are not sorry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florencio.</span> No, my Carolina, the glory
of being your husband far outweighs in
my eyes the disadvantages of being the
husband of his widow.</p>

<p>[<i>Scene laid in a retired part of a park
in Madrid, Spain. A bench at right.
Bright, sunny morning in autumn. Do&ntilde;a
Laura, a handsome old lady of about 70,
with white hair and of very refined appearance,
although elderly, her bright
eyes and entire manner prove her mental
facilities are unimpaired. She enters accompanied
by her maid Petra, upon whose
arm she leans with one hand, while the
other holds a parasol which she uses as a
cane.</i>]</p>

What a beautiful morning!</p>

than usual. [<i>Noticing Petra, who seems
impatient.</i>] Go, if you wish to chat with
your guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> He is not my guard, Se&ntilde;ora;
he belongs to the park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> He belongs more to you
than to the park. Go seek him, but remain
within calling distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> I see him over there waiting
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Do not remain away
more than ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> Very well, Se&ntilde;ora. [<i>Walks
toward right, but is detained.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Wait a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> What does the Se&ntilde;ora wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You are carrying away
the bread crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> Very true. I don't know
where my head is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I do. It is
where your heart is&mdash;with your guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petra.</span> Here, Se&ntilde;ora. [<i>She hands
Do&ntilde;a Laura a small bag. Exit Petra.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Adios. [<i>Glancing toward
trees.</i>] Here come the rogues.
They know just when to expect me.
[<i>She rises, walks toward right, throws
three handfuls of bread crumbs.</i>] These
are for the most daring, these for the
gluttons, and these for the little ones
which are the biggest rogues. Ha, ha.
[<i>She returns to her seat and watches with
a pleased expression, the pigeons feeding.</i>]
There, that big one is always the
first. That little fellow is the least timid.
I believe he would eat from my hand.
That one takes his piece and flies to that
branch. He is a philosopher. But from
where do they all come? It seems as if
the news had been carried. Ha, ha.
Don't quarrel. There is enough for all.
To-morrow I'll bring more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juanito.</span> But there is none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> But that one over there

<p><span class="smcap">Juanito.</span> But there are three priests

Have they gone, Juanito?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juanito.</span> No, indeed. They are in

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Just as if they were

Come this way, Juanito. [<i>They

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes, to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> What do you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You have scared away
the birds who were feeding on bread

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> What do I care about
the birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> But I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> This is a public park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Then why do you complain
that the priests have taken your
bench?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Se&ntilde;ora, we have not
been introduced to each other. I do not
know why you take the liberty of addressing
me. Come, Juanito. [<i>Both

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> What an ill-natured old
man. Why must some people get so fussy
and cross when they reach a certain age?
I am glad. He lost that bench, too.
Serves him right for scaring the birds.
He is furious. Yes, yes; find a seat if
you can. Poor fellow! He is wiping the

comes. A carriage would not raise more

<p><span class="smcap">Juanito.</span> No, indeed, Se&ntilde;or. They
are still there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> The authorities should
place more benches here for these sunny

myself and sit on the same bench

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I repeat that we have

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> I am responding to
your greeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Good morning should
be answered by good morning, and that is
what you should have said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> And you should have
asked permission to sit on this bench

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> The benches here are

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Why, you said the one

your shoes with your handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> By the rights of a neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Many hares and partridges
could bear testimony to my words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Do you hunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I did, and even now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Oh, yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, Se&ntilde;ora. Every
Sunday I take my gun and dog, you understand,
and go to one of my properties
near Aravaca, just to kill time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes, to kill time. That
is all you can kill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Do you think so? I
could show you a wild boar's head in my

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Well, keep quiet then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> But first I shall take

Will you have some? [<i>Offers box to

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> If it is good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> It is of the finest.
You will like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>taking pinch of snuff</i>].
It clears my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Do you sneeze?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, Se&ntilde;ora, three

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> And so do I. What a
coincidence!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>After taking the snuff, they await

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> So do I. [<i>Aside.</i>] The

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> You will excuse me if
I read aloud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Read as you please;
you will not disturb me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>reading</i>]. "All love is
sad, but sad and all, it is the best thing
that exists." That is from Campoamor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>reading</i>]. "The daughters
of the mothers I once loved, kiss me
now as they would kiss a wooden image."
Those lines are in the humorous
vein.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. So I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> There are some beautiful
poems in this book. Listen: "Twenty
years have passed. He returns."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You cannot imagine how
it affects me to see you reading with all
those glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Can it be possible that
you read without requiring any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> At your age? You
must be jesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Pass me the book,
please. [<i>takes book, reads aloud.</i>]
"Twenty years have passed. He returns.
And each upon beholding the other exclaims&mdash;Can
it be possible that this is
he? Merciful heavens, can this be she?"</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Do&ntilde;a Laura returns book to Don

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Indeed, you are to be
envied for your wonderful eyesight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. I knew the lines
from memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I am very fond of good
verse, very fond. I even composed some
in my youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Good ones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Of all kinds. I was a
great friend of Espronceda, Zorrilla, Becquer
and others. I first met Zorrilla in
America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Why, have you been in
America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Several times. The
first time I went I was only six years
old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Columbus must have
carried you in one of his caravels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Not quite
as bad as that. I am old, I admit, but
I did not know Ferdinand and Isabella.
[<i>They both laugh.</i>] I was also a great
friend of Campoamor. I met him in
Valencia. I am a native of that city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I was brought up there
and there I spent my early youth. Have
you ever visited that city?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes, Se&ntilde;or. Not far
from Valencia there was a mansion that
if still there, should retain memories of
me. I spent there several seasons. This
was many, many years ago. It was near
the sea, concealed among lemon and
orange trees. They called it&mdash;let me
see, what did they call it?&mdash;"Maricela."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>startled</i>]. Maricela?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Maricela. Is the name
familiar to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, very familiar.
If my memory serves me right, for we
forget as we grow old, there lived in that
mansion the most beautiful woman I have
ever seen, and I assure you I have seen a
few. Let me see&mdash;what was her name?
Laura&mdash;Laura&mdash;Laura Lorente.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>startled</i>]. Laura Lorente?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes. [<i>They look at
each other strangely.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>recovering herself</i>].
Nothing. You reminded me of my best
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> How strange!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> It is strange. She was
called "The Silver Maiden."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Precisely, "The Silver
Maiden." By that name she was known
in that locality. I seem to see her as if
she were before me now, at that window
of the red roses. Do you remember that
window?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes, I remember. It
was that of her room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> She spent many hours
there. I mean in my days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>sighing</i>]. And in mine,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> She was ideal. Fair
as a lily, jet black hair and black eyes,
with a very sweet expression. She seemed
to cast a radiance wherever she was.
Her figure was beautiful, perfect. "What
forms of sovereign beauty God models in
human sculpture!" She was a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. If you but knew
that dream was now by your side, you
would realize what dreams are worth.
[<i>Aloud</i>.] She was very unfortunate and
had a sad love affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Very sad. [<i>They look
at each other.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You know of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes.
<span class="smcap">
Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Strange are
the ways of Providence! This man is my
early lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> The gallant lover, if
we refer to the same affair&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> To the duel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Precisely, to the duel.
The gallant lover was&mdash;my cousin, of
whom I was very fond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Oh, yes, a cousin. My
friend told me in one of her letters the
story of that love affair, truly romantic.
He, your cousin, passed by on horseback
every morning by the rose path under
her window, and tossed up to her balcony
a bouquet of flowers which she
caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And later in the afternoon,
the gallant horseman would return
by the same path, and catch the bouquet
of flowers she would toss him. Was it
not so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes. They wanted to
marry her to a merchant whom she did
not fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And one night, when
my cousin watched under her window to
hear her sing, this new lover presented
himself unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> And insulted your cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> There was a quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> And later a duel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, at sunrise, on the
beach, and the merchant was badly
wounded. My cousin had to conceal himself
for a few days and later to fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> You seem to know the
story perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And so do you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> I have told you that my
friend related it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And my cousin to me.
[<i>Aside.</i>] This woman is Laura. What
a strange fate has brought us together
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. He does not
suspect who I am. Why tell him? Let
him preserve his illusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>aside</i>]. She does not
suspect she is talking to her old lover.
How can she? I will not reveal my
identity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> And was it you, by
chance, who advised your cousin to forget
Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Why, my cousin never
forgot her for one instant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> How do you account,
then, for his conduct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I will explain. The
young man first took refuge in my house,
fearful of the consequences of his duel
with that man, so much beloved in that
locality. From my home he went to
Seville, then came to Madrid. He wrote
to Laura many letters, some in verse.
But, undoubtedly, they were intercepted
by her parents, for she never answered
them. Gonzalo then, in despair, and believing
his loved one lost to him forever,
joined the army, went to Africa, and
there, in a trench, met a glorious death,
grasping the flag of Spain and repeating
the name of his beloved&mdash;Laura&mdash;Laura&mdash;Laura.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. What an atrocious
lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>aside</i>]. I could not
have killed myself in a more glorious
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Such a calamity must
have caused you the greatest sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, indeed, Se&ntilde;ora.
As great as if it were a brother. I presume
though, that on the contrary, Laura
in a short time was chasing butterflies
in her garden, indifferent to everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> No, Se&ntilde;or, no indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> It is usually a woman's
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Even if you consider it
a woman's way, the "Silver Maiden" was
not of that disposition. My friend awaited
news for days, months, a year, and
no letter came. One afternoon, just at
sunset, and as the first stars were appearing,
she was seen to leave the house,
and with quick steps, wend her way toward
the beach, that beach where her
beloved had risked his life. She wrote
his name on the sand, then sat upon a
rock, her gaze fixed upon the horizon.
The waves murmured their eternal monologue
and slowly covered the rock where
the maiden sat. Shall I tell you the rest?&mdash;The
tide rose and carried her off to
sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Good heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> The fishermen of that
sea-coast who tell the story, affirm that it
was a long time before the waves washed
away that name written on the sand.
[<i>Aside.</i>] You will not get ahead of me
in inventing a romantic death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>aside</i>]. She lies
more than I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Poor Laura!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Poor Gonzalo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>aside</i>]. I will not tell
him that in two years I married another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>aside</i>]. I will not
tell her that in three months I went to
Paris with a ballet dancer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> What strange pranks
Fate plays! Here you and I, complete
strangers, met by chance, and in discussing
the romance of friends of long
ago, we have been conversing as we were
old friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Yes, it is strange, considering
we commenced our conversation
quarreling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Because you scared
away the birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> I was in a bad temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Yes, that was evident.
[<i>Sweetly.</i>] Are you coming to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> Most certainly, if it is
a sunny morning. And not only will I
not scare away the birds, but will also
bring them bread crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> Thank you very much.
They are very interesting and deserve
to be noticed. I wonder where my maid
is? [<i>Do&ntilde;a Laura rises; Don Gonzalo
also rises.</i>] What time can it be? [<i>Do&ntilde;a
Laura walks toward left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> It is nearly twelve
o'clock. Where can that scamp Juanito
be? [<i>Walks toward right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura.</span> There she is talking with
her guard. [<i>Signals with her hand for
her maid to approach.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo</span> [<i>looking at Laura,

flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Do&ntilde;a Laura</span> [<i>looking at Gonzalo,

will not tell him I am Laura. I am too
sadly altered. It is better he should remember
me as the blackeyed girl who
tossed him flowers as he passed through
the rose path in that garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Gonzalo.</span> And I will surely bring
the bread crumbs. [<i>Both laugh again.</i>]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A small watering-place. Time,
the present. Stage directions with reference

<p><i>A drawing-room in a watering-place;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Adolf sits on the settee on the left of
the square table; his stick is propped up
near him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And it's you I've got to thank
for all this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>walks up and down on the
right, smoking a cigar</i>]. Oh, nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Indeed, I have. Why, the first
day after my wife went away, I lay on
my sofa like a cripple and gave myself
up to my depression; it was as though
she had taken my crutches, and I couldn't
move from the spot. A few days went
by, and I cheered up and began to pull
myself together. The delirious nightmares
which my brain had produced,
went away. My head became cooler and
cooler. A thought which I once had
came to the surface again. My desire
to work, my impulse to create, woke up.
My eye got back again its capacity for
sound sharp observation. You came, old
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes, you were in pretty low
water, old man, when I came across you,
and you went about on crutches. Of
course, that doesn't prove that it was
simply my presence that helped so much
to your recovery: you needed quiet, and
you wanted masculine companionship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You're right in that, as you
are in everything else you say. I used
to have it in the old days. But after my
marriage it seemed unnecessary. I was
satisfied with the friend of my heart
whom I had chosen. All the same I soon
got into fresh sets, and made many new
acquaintances. But then my wife got
jealous. She wanted to have me quite
to herself; but much worse than that,
my friends wanted to have her quite to
themselves&mdash;and so I was left out in the
cold with my jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You were predisposed to this
illness, you know that.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He passes on the left behind the
square table and comes to Adolf's
left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I was afraid of losing her&mdash;and
tried to prevent it. Are you surprised
at it? I was never afraid for a
moment that she'd be unfaithful to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> What husband ever was
afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Strange, isn't it? All I
troubled about was simply this&mdash;about
friends getting influence over her and
so being able indirectly to acquire power
over me&mdash;and I couldn't bear that at
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> So you and your wife didn't
have quite identical views?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I've told you so much, you
may as well know everything&mdash;-my wife
is an independent character. [<i>Gustav
laughs.</i>] What are you laughing at, old
man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Go on, go on. She's an independent
character, is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> She won't take anything from
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But she does from everybody
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Yes. And
I've felt about all this, that the only
reason why my views were so awfully repugnant
to her, was because they were
mine, not because they appeared absurd
on their intrinsic merits. For it often
happened that she'd trot out my old
ideas, and champion them with gusto as
her own. Why, it even came about that
one of my friends gave her ideas which
he had borrowed direct from me. She
found them delightful; she found everything
delightful that didn't come from
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> In other words, you're not
truly happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh yes, I am. The woman
whom I desired is mine, and I never
wished for any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Do you never wish to be free
either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I wouldn't like to go quite so
far as that. Of course the thought crops
up now and again, how calmly I should
be able to live if I were free&mdash;but she
scarcely leaves me before I immediately
long for her again, as though she were
my arm, my leg. Strange. When I'm
alone I sometimes feel as though she
didn't have any real self of her own, as
though she were a part of my ego, a
piece out of my inside, that stole away
all my will, all my <i>joie de vivre</i>. Why,
my very marrow itself, to use an anatomical
expression, is situated in her;
that's what it seems like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Viewing the matter broadly,
that seems quite plausible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Nonsense. An independent
person like she is, with such a tremendous
lot of personal views, and when I
met her, what was I then? Nothing. An
artistic child which she brought up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But afterwards you developed
her intellect and educated her, didn't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No; her growth remained stationary,
and I shot up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes; it's really remarkable,
but her literary talent already began to
deteriorate after her first book, or, to
put it as charitably as possible, it didn't
develop any further. [<i>He sits down opposite
Adolf on the sofa on the left.</i>]
Of course she then had the most promising
subject-matter&mdash;for of course she
drew the portrait of her first husband&mdash;you
never knew him, old man? He must
have been an unmitigated ass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I've never seen him. He was
away for more than six months, but the
good fellow must have been as perfect
an ass as they're made, judging by her
description&mdash;you can take it from me,
old man, that her description wasn't exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite; but why did she marry
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> She didn't know him then.
People only get to know one another
afterwards, don't you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But, according to that, people
have no business to marry until&mdash;Well,
the man was a tyrant, obviously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Obviously?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> What husband wouldn't be?
[<i>Casually.</i>] Why, old chap, you're as
much a tyrant as any of the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Me? I? Well, I allow my
wife to come and go as she jolly well
pleases!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>stands up</i>]. Pah! a lot of
good that is. I didn't suppose you kept
her locked up. [<i>He turns round behind
the square table and comes over to Adolf
on the right.</i>] Don't you mind if she's
out all night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I should think I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Look here. [<i>Resuming his
earlier tone.</i>] Speaking as man to man,
it simply makes you ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Ridiculous? Can a man's
trusting his wife make him ridiculous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Of course it can. And you've
been so for some time. No doubt about
it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He walks round the round table on
the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Me? I'd have
preferred to be anything but that. I
must put matters right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Don't you get so excited,
otherwise you'll get an attack again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Why doesn't
she look ridiculous when I stay out all
night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Why? Don't you bother
about that. That's how the matter
stands, and while you're fooling about
moping, the mischief is done.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes behind the square table,
and walks behind the sofa.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What mischief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Her husband, you know, was
a tyrant, and she simply married him in
order to be free. For what other way
is there for a girl to get free, than by
getting the so-called husband to act as
cover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Why, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And now, old man, you're the
cover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> As her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>looks absent</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Am I not right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. I don't know.
[<i>Pause.</i>] A man lives for years on end
with a woman without coming to a clear
conclusion about the woman herself, or
how she stands in relation to his own
way of looking at things. And then all
of a sudden a man begins to reflect&mdash;and
then there's no stopping. Gustav, old
man, you're my friend, the only friend
I've had for a long time, and this last
week you've given me back all my life
and pluck. It seems as though you'd
radiated your magnetism over me. You
were the watchmaker who repairs the
works in my brain, and tightened the
spring. [<i>Pause.</i>] Don't you see yourself
how much more lucidly I think, how
much more connectedly I speak, and at
times it almost seems as though my
voice had got back the timbre it used to
have in the old days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I think so, too. What can be
the cause of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I don't know. Perhaps one
gets accustomed to talk more softly to
women. Thekla, at any rate, was always
ragging me because I shrieked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And then you subsided into
a minor key, and allowed yourself to be
put in the corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Don't say that. [<i>Reflectively.</i>]
That wasn't the worst of it. Let's
talk of something else&mdash;where was I
then&mdash;I've got it. [<i>Gustav turns round
again at the back of the square table and
comes to Adolf on his right.</i>] You came
here, old man, and opened my eyes to the
mysteries of my art. As a matter of
fact, I've been feeling for some time that
my interest in painting was lessening,
because it didn't provide me with a
proper medium to express what I had
in me; but when you gave me the reason
for this state of affairs, and explained
to me why painting could not possibly
be the right form for the artistic impulse
of the age, then I saw the true light and
I recognized that it would be from now
onwards impossible for me to create in
colors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Are you so certain, old man,
that you won't be able to paint any more,
that you won't have any relapse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Quite. I have tested myself.
When I went to bed the evening after
our conversation I reviewed your chain of
argument point by point, and felt convinced
that it was sound. But the next
morning, when my head cleared again,
after the night's sleep, the thought flashed
through me like lightning that you might
be mistaken all the same. I jumped up,
and snatched up a brush and palette, in
order to paint, but&mdash;just think of it!&mdash;it
was all up. I was no longer capable
of any illusion. The whole thing
was nothing but blobs of color, and I was
horrified at the thought. I could never
have believed I could convert any one else
to the belief that painted canvas was
anything else except painted canvas.
The scales had fallen from my eyes, and
I could as much paint again as I could
become a child again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You realized then that the
real striving of the age, its aspiration
for reality, for actuality, can only find
a corresponding medium in sculpture,
which gives bodies extension in the three
dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. The three dimensions?
Yes&mdash;in a word, bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And now you want to become
a sculptor? That means that you were
a sculptor really from the beginning;
you got off the line somehow, so you only
needed a guide to direct you back again
to the right track. I say, when you work
now, does the great joy of creation come
over you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Now, I live again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> May I see what you're doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>undraping a figure on the
small table</i>]. A female figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>probing</i>]. Without a model,
and yet so lifelike?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>heavily</i>]. Yes, but it is like
somebody; extraordinary how this woman
is in me, just as I am in her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> That last is not so extraordinary&mdash;do
you know anything about
transfusion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Blood transfusion? Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> It seems to me that you've
allowed your veins to be opened a bit too
much. The examination of this figure
clears up many things which I'd previously
only surmised. You loved her
infinitely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes; so much that I could
never tell whether she is I, or I am her;
when she laughed I laughed; when she
cried I cried, and when&mdash;just imagine
it&mdash;our child came into the world I suffered
the same as she did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>stepping a little to the right</i>].
Look here, old chap, I am awfully sorry
to have to tell you, but the symptoms
of epilepsy are already manifesting themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>crushed</i>]. In me? What
makes you say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Because I watched these
symptoms in a younger brother of mine,
who eventually died of excess.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He sits down in the arm-chair by
the circular table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> How did it manifest itself&mdash;that
disease, I mean?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Gustav gesticulates vividly; Adolf
watches with strained attention,
and involuntarily imitates Gustav's
gestures.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> A ghastly sight. If you feel
at all off color, I'd rather not harrow
you by describing the symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Go on; go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, it's like this. Fate had
given the youngster for a wife a little
innocent, with kiss-curls, dove-like eyes,
and a baby face, from which there spoke
the pure soul of an angel. In spite of
that, the little one managed to appropriate
the man's prerogative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Initiative, of course; and the
inevitable result was that the angel came
precious near taking him away to heaven.
He first had to be on the cross and feel
the nails in his flesh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>suffocating</i>]. Tell me, what
was it like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. There were times
when he and I would sit quite quietly
by each other and chat, and then&mdash;I'd
scarcely been speaking a few minutes before
his face became ashy white, his
limbs were paralyzed, and his thumbs
turned in towards the palm of the hand.
[<i>With a gesture.</i>] Like that! [<i>Adolf
imitates the gesture.</i>] And his eyes were
shot with blood, and he began to chew,
do you see, like this. [<i>He moves his lips
as though chewing; Adolf imitates him
again.</i>] The saliva stuck in his throat;
the chest contracted as though it had been
compressed by screws on a joiner's bench;
there was a flicker in the pupils like gas
jets; foam spurted from his mouth, and
he sank gently back in the chair as though
he were drowning. Then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>hissing</i>]. Stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Then&mdash;are you unwell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>gets up and fetches a glass of
water from the table on the right near
the center door</i>]. Here, drink this, and
let's change the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>drinks, limp</i>]. Thanks; go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Good! When he woke up he
had no idea what had taken place. [<i>He
takes the glass back to the table.</i>] He
had simply lost consciousness. Hasn't
that ever happened to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Now and again I have attacks
of dizziness. The doctor puts it down
to an&aelig;mia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>on the right of Adolf</i>]. That's
just how the thing starts, mark you.
Take it from me, you're in danger of
contracting epilepsy; if you aren't on
your guard, if you don't live a careful
and abstemious life, all round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What can I do to effect that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Above all, you must exercise
the most complete continence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> For how long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Six months at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't do it. It would upset
all our life together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Then it's all up with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You can't save your own life?
But tell me, as you've taken me into
your confidence so far, haven't you any
other wound that hurts you?&mdash;some
other secret trouble in this multifarious
life of ours, with all its numerous opportunities
for jars and complications?
There is usually more than one <i>motif</i>
which is responsible for a discord.
Haven't you got a skeleton in the cupboard,
old chap, which you hide even
from yourself? You told me a minute
ago you'd given your child to people to
look after. Why didn't you keep it with
you?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes behind the square table on
the left and then behind the sofa.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>covers the figure on the small
table with a cloth</i>]. It was my wife's
wish to have it nursed outside the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> The motive? Don't be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Because when the kid was
three years old she thought it began to
look like her first husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Re-a-lly? Ever seen the first
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, never. I just once cast a
cursory glance over a bad photograph,
but I couldn't discover any likeness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh, well, photographs are
never like, and besides, his type of face
may have changed with time. By the
by, didn't that make you at all jealous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Not a bit. The child was born
a year after our marriage, and the husband
was traveling when I met Thekla,
here&mdash;in this watering-place&mdash;in this
very house. That's why we come here
every summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Then all suspicion on your
part was out of the question? But so
far as the intrinsic facts of the matter
are concerned you needn't be jealous at
all, because it not infrequently happens
that the children of a widow who marries
again are like the deceased husband.
Very awkward business, no question
about it; and that's why, don't you know,
the widows are burned alive in India.
Tell me, now, didn't you ever feel jealous
of him, of the survival of his memory in
your own self? Wouldn't it have rather
gone against the grain if he had just met
you when you were out for a walk, and,
looking straight at Thekla, said "We,"
instead of "I"? "We."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't deny that the thought
has haunted me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>sits down opposite Adolf on
the sofa on the left</i>]. I thought as much,
and you'll never get away from it. There
are discords in life, you know, which
never get resolved, so you must stuff
your ears with wax, and work. Work,
get older, and heap up over the coffin a
mass of new impressions, and then the
corpse will rest in peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Excuse my interrupting you&mdash;but
it is extraordinary at times how
your way of speaking reminds me of
Thekla. You've got a trick, old man, of
winking with your right eye as though
you were counting, and your gaze has the
same power over me as hers has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No, really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And now you pronounce your
"No, really?" in the same indifferent
tone that she does. "No, really?" is one
of her favorite expressions, too, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Perhaps there is a distant relationship
between us: all men and women
are related of course. Anyway, there's
no getting away from the strangeness
of it, and it will be interesting for me to
make the acquaintance of your wife, so
as to observe this remarkable characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But just think of this, she
doesn't take a single expression from me;
why, she seems rather to make a point of
avoiding all my special tricks of speech;
all the same, I have seen her make use of
one of my gestures; but it is quite the
usual thing in married life for a husband
and a wife to develop the so-called
marriage likeness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite. But look here now.
[<i>He stands up.</i>] That woman has never
loved you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Pray excuse me, woman's love
consists simply in this&mdash;in taking in, in
receiving. She does not love the man
from whom she takes nothing: she has
never loved you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns round behind the square
table and walks to Adolf's right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I suppose you don't think that
she'd be able to love more than once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No. Once bit, twice shy.
After the first time, one keeps one's eyes
open, but you have never been really
bitten yet. You be careful of those who
have; they're dangerous customers.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes round the circular table on
the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What you say jabs a knife into
my flesh. I've got a feeling as though
something in me were cut through, but
I can do nothing to stop it all by myself,
and it's as well it should be so, for
abscesses will be opened in that way
which would otherwise never be able to
come to a head. She never loved me?
Why did she marry me, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Tell me first how it came
about that she did marry you, and
whether she married you or you her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> God knows! That's much too
hard a question to be answered offhand,
and how did it take place?&mdash;it took more
than a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Shall I guess?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes behind the round table, toward
the left, and sits on the <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'soft'">sofa</ins>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You'll get nothing for your
pains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Not so fast! From the insight
which you've given me into your
own character, and that of your wife,
I find it pretty easy to work out the sequence
of the whole thing. Listen to me
and you'll be quite convinced. [<i>Dispassionately
and in an almost jocular tone.</i>]
The husband happened to be traveling
on study and she was alone. At first
she found a pleasure in being free. Then
she imagined that she felt the void, for
I presume that she found it pretty boring
after being alone for a fortnight.
Then he turned up, and the void begins
gradually to be filled&mdash;the picture of the
absent man begins gradually to fade in
comparison, for the simple reason that
he is a long way off&mdash;you know of course
the psychological algebra of distance?
And when both of them, alone as they
were, felt the awakening of passion, they
were frightened of themselves, of him,
of their own conscience. They sought for
protection, skulked behind the fig-leaf,
played at brother and sister, and the more
sensual grew their feelings the more
spiritual did they pretend their relationship
really was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Brother and sister! How did
you know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I just thought that was how
it was. Children play at mother and
father, but of course when they grow
older they play at brother and sister&mdash;so
as to conceal what requires concealment;
they then discard their chaste desires;
they play blind man's bluff till
they've caught each other in some dark
corner, where they're pretty sure not to
be seen by anybody. [<i>With increased
severity.</i>] But they are warned by their
inner consciences that an eye sees them
through the darkness. They are afraid&mdash;and
in their panic the absent man begins
to haunt their imagination&mdash;to assume
monstrous proportions&mdash;to become
metamorphosed&mdash;he becomes a nightmare
who oppresses them in that love's
young dream of theirs. He becomes the
creditor [<i>he raps slowly on the table
three times with his finger, as though
knocking at the door</i>] who knocks at the
door. They see his black hand thrust
itself between them when their own are
reaching after the dish of pottage. They
hear his unwelcome voice in the stillness
of the night, which is only broken by the
beating of their own pulses. He doesn't
prevent their belonging to each other, but
he is enough to mar their happiness, and
when they have felt this invisible power
of his, and when at last they want to
run away, and make their futile efforts
to escape the memory which haunts them,
the guilt which they have left behind, the
public opinion which they are afraid of,
and they lack the strength to bear their
own guilt, then a scapegoat has to be
exterminated and slaughtered. They
posed as believers in Free Love, but they
didn't have the pluck to go straight to
him, to speak straight out to him and
say, "We love each other." They were
cowardly, and that's why the tyrant had
to be assassinated. Am I not right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes; but you're forgetting
that she trained me, gave me new
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I haven't forgotten it. But
tell me, how was it that she wasn't able to
succeed in educating the other man&mdash;in
educating him into being really modern?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> He was an utter ass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Right you are&mdash;he was an
ass; but that's a fairly elastic word, and
according to her description of him, in
her novel, his asinine nature seemed to
have consisted principally in the fact that
he didn't understand her. Excuse the
question, but is your wife really as deep
as all that? I haven't found anything
particularly profound in her writings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Nor have I. I must really
own that I too find it takes me all my
time to understand her. It's as though
the machinery of our brains couldn't
catch on to each other properly&mdash;as
though something in my head got broken
when I try to understand her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Perhaps you're an ass as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I flatter myself I'm not
that, and I nearly always think that she's
in the wrong&mdash;and, for the sake of argument,
would you care to read this letter
which I got from her to-day?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He takes a letter out of his pocketbook.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>reads it cursorily</i>]. Hum, I
seem to know the style so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Like a man's, almost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, at any rate I know a
man who had a style like that. [<i>Standing
up.</i>] I see she goes on calling you
brother all the time&mdash;do you always keep
up the comedy for the benefit of your
two selves? Do you still keep on using
the fig leaves, even though they're a trifle
withered&mdash;you don't use any term of
endearment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No. In my view, I couldn't
respect her quite so much if I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>hands back the letter</i>]. I see,
and she calls herself "sister" so as to
inspire respect.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns around and passes the
square table on Adolf's right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I want to esteem her more
than I do myself. I want her to be my
better self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh, you be your better self;
though I quite admit it's less convenient
than having somebody else to do it for
you. Do you want, then, to be your wife's
inferior?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, I do. I find pleasure in
always allowing myself to be beaten by
her a little. For instance, I taught her
swimming, and it amuses me when she
boasts about being better and pluckier
than I am. At the beginning I simply
pretended to be less skillful and courageous
than she was, in order to give her
pluck, but one day, God knows how it
came about, I was actually the worse
swimmer and the one with less pluck.
It seemed as though she's taken all my
grit away in real earnest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And haven't you taught her
anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes&mdash;but this is in confidence&mdash;I
taught her spelling, because she
didn't know it. Just listen to this. When
she took over the correspondence of the
household I gave up writing letters, and&mdash;will
you believe it?&mdash;simply from lack
of practice I've lost one bit of grammar
after another in the course of the year.
But do you think she ever remembers
that she has to thank me really for her
proficiency? Not for a minute. Of
course, I'm the ass now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Ah, really? You're the ass
now, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I'm only joking, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Obviously. But this is pure
cannibalism, isn't it? Do you know what
I mean? Well, the savages devour their
enemies so as to acquire their best
qualities. Well, this woman has devoured
your soul, your pluck, your
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And my faith. It was I who
kept her up to the mark and made her
write her first book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>with facial expression</i>].
Re-a-lly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> It was I who fed her up with
praise, even when I thought her work
was no good. It was I who introduced
her into literary sets, and tried to make
her feel herself in clover; defended her
against criticism by my personal intervention.
I blew courage into her, kept
on blowing it for so long that I got out
of breath myself. I gave and gave and
gave&mdash;until nothing was left for me myself.
Do you know&mdash;I'm going to tell
you the whole story&mdash;do you know how
the thing seems to me now? One's temperament
is such an extraordinary thing,
and when my artistic successes looked as
though they would eclipse her&mdash;her prestige&mdash;I
tried to buck her up by belittling
myself and by representing that my art
was one that was inferior to hers. I
talked so much of the general insignificant
r&ocirc;le of my particular art, and harped
on it so much, thought of so many good
reasons for my contention, that one fine
day I myself was soaked through and
through with the worthlessness of the
painter's art; so all that was left was a
house of cards for you to blow down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Excuse my reminding you of
what you said, but at the beginning of
our conversation you were asserting that
she took nothing from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> She doesn't&mdash;now, at any
rate; now there is nothing left to take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> So the snake has gorged herself,
and now she vomits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Perhaps she took more from
me than I knew of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh, you can reckon on that
right enough&mdash;she took without your
noticing it. [<i>He goes behind the square
table and comes in front of the sofa.</i>]
That's what people call stealing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Then what it comes to is that
she hasn't educated me at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Rather you her. Of course
she knew the trick well enough of making
you believe the contrary. Might I
ask how she pretended to educate you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh&mdash;at first&mdash;hum!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well? [<i>He leans his arms
on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Well, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No; it was she&mdash;she.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> As a matter of fact I couldn't
say which it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Besides, she destroyed my
faith as well, and so I went backward
until you came, old chap, and gave me a
new faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>he laughs</i>]. In sculpture?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns round by the square table
and comes to Adolf's right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And you believed in it?&mdash;in
that abstract, obsolete art from the childhood
of the world. Do you believe that
by means of pure form and three dimensions&mdash;no,
you don't really&mdash;that you
can produce an effect on the real spirit
of this age of ours, that you can create
illusions without color? Without color,
I say. Do you believe that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>tonelessly</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Nor do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But why did you say you did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You make me pity you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, I am indeed to be pitied.
And now I'm bankrupt, absolutely&mdash;and
the worst of it is I haven't got her
any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>with a few steps toward the
right</i>]. What good would she be to you?
She would be what God above was
to me before I became an atheist&mdash;a
subject on which I could lavish my reverence.
You keep your feeling of reverence
dark, and let something else grow
on top of it&mdash;a healthy contempt, for
instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't live without some one
to reverence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Slave!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes round the table on the
right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And without a woman to reverence,
to worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh, the deuce! Then you go
back to that God of yours&mdash;if you really
must have something on which you can
crucify yourself; but you call yourself an
atheist when you've got the superstitious
belief in women in your own blood; you
call yourself a free thinker when you
can't think freely about a lot of silly
women. Do you know what all this illusive
quality, this sphinx-like mystery, this
profundity in your wife's temperament
all really comes to? The whole thing is
sheer stupidity; why, the woman can't
distinguish between A.B. and bull's foot
for the life of her. And look here, it's
something shoddy in the mechanism,
that's where the fault lies. Outside it
looks like a fifty-guinea hunting watch,
open it and you find it's tuppenny-halfpenny
gun-metal. [<i>He comes up to
Adolf.</i>] Put her in trousers, draw a
mustache under her nose with a piece
of coal, and then listen to her in the same
state of mind, and then you'll be perfectly
convinced that it is quite a different
kettle of fish altogether&mdash;-a gramaphone
which reproduces, with rather less
volume, your words and other people's
words. Do you know how a woman is
constituted? Yes, of course you do. A
boy with the breasts of a mother, an immature
man, a precocious child whose
growth has been stunted, a chronically
an&aelig;mic creature that has a regular emission
of blood thirteen times in the year.
What can you do with a thing like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes&mdash;but&mdash;but then how can
I believe&mdash;that we are really on an
equality?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>moves away from him again
towards the right</i>]. Sheer hallucination!
The fascination of the petticoat. But it
is so; perhaps, in fact you have become
like each other, the leveling has taken
place. But I say. [<i>He takes out his
watch.</i>] We've been chatting for quite
long enough. Your wife's bound to be
here shortly. Wouldn't it be better to
leave off now, so that you can rest for a
little?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He comes nearer and holds out his
hand to say good-by. Adolf grips
his hand all the tighter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> NO, don't leave me. I haven't
got the pluck to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Only for a little while. Your
wife will be coming in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, yes&mdash;she's coming.
[<i>Pause.</i>] Strange, isn't it? I long for
her and yet I'm frightened of her. She
caresses me, she is tender, but her kisses
have something in them which smothers
one, something which sucks, something
which stupefies. It is as though I were
the child at the circus whose face the
clown is making up in the dressing-room,
so that it can appear red-cheeked before
the public.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>leaning on the arm of Adolf's
chair</i>]. I'm sorry for you, old man. Although
I'm not a doctor I am in a position
to tell you that you are a dying man.
One only has to look at your last pictures
to be quite clear on the point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What do you say&mdash;what do
you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Your coloring is so watery,
so consumptive and thin, that the yellow
of the canvas shines through. It is just
as though your hollow ashen white cheeks
were looking out at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes, and that's not only my
view. Haven't you read to-day's paper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>he starts</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> It's before you on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>he gropes after the paper without
having the courage to take it</i>]. Is
it in here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Read it, or shall I read it to
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>turns to leave</i>]. If you prefer
it, I'll go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> NO, no, no! I don't know how
it is&mdash;I think I am beginning to hate you,
but all the same I can't do without your
being near me. You have helped to drag
me out of the slough which I was in, and,
as luck would have it, I just managed to
work my way clear and then you knocked
me on the head and plunged me in again.
As long as I kept my secrets to myself
I still had some guts&mdash;now I'm empty.
There's a picture by an Italian master
that describes a torture scene. The entrails
are dragged out of a saint by means
of a windlass. The martyr lies there
and sees himself getting continually thinner
and thinner, but the roll on the windless
always gets perpetually fatter, and
so it seems to me that you get stronger
since you've taken me up and that you're
taking away now with you, as you go, my
innermost essence, the core of my character,
and there's nothing left of me but
an empty husk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh, what fantastic notions;
besides, your wife is coming back with
your heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No; no longer, after you have
burnt it for me. You have passed
through me, changing everything in your
track to ashes&mdash;my art, my love, my
hope, my faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>comes near to him again</i>].
Were you so splendidly off before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I wasn't, but the situation
might have been saved; now it's too late.
Murderer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> We've wasted a little time.
Now we'll do some sowing in the ashes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I hate you! I curse you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> A healthy symptom. You've
still got some strength, and now I'll
screw up your machinery again. I say.
[<i>He goes behind the square table on the
left and comes in front of the sofa.</i>]
Will you listen to me and obey me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Do what you will with me, I'll
obey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Look at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>looks him in the face</i>]. And
now you look at me again with that other
expression in those eyes of yours, which
draws me to you irresistibly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Now listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, but speak of yourself.
Don't speak any more of me: it's as
though I were wounded, every movement
hurts me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh no, there isn't much to say
about me, don't you know. I'm a private
tutor in dead languages and a widower,
that's all. [<i>He goes in front of the
table.</i>] Hold my hand.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Adolf does so.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> What awful strength you must
have, it seems as though a fellow were
catching hold of an electric battery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And just think, I was once
quite as weak as you are. [<i>Sternly.</i>]
Get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>gets up</i>]. I am like a child
without any bones, and my brain is
empty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Take a walk through the
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You must; if you don't I'll
hit you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>stands up</i>]. What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I've told you&mdash;I'll hit you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>jumps back to the circular
table on the right, beside himself.</i>] You!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>follows him</i>]. Bravo! That's
driven the blood to your head, and woken
up your self-respect. Now I'll give you
an electric shock. Where's your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Where's my wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> At&mdash;a meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Certain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> What kind of a meeting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> An orphan association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Did you part friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]. Not friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Enemies, then? What did
you say to make her angry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You're terrible. I'm frightened
of you. How did you manage to
know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I've just got three known
quantities, and by their help I work out
the unknown. What did you say to her,
old chap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I said&mdash;only two words&mdash;but
two awful words. I regret them&mdash;I regret
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You shouldn't do that. Well,
speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I said, "Old coquette."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And what else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I didn't say anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh yes, you did; you've only
forgotten it. Perhaps because you
haven't got the pluck to remember it.
You've locked it up in a secret pigeonhole;
open it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But I know what it was&mdash;the
sense was roughly this: "You ought
to be ashamed of yourself to be always
flirting at your age. You're getting too
old to find any more admirers."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Did I say that&mdash;possibly?
How did you manage to know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> On my way here I heard her
tell the story on the steamer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> To whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>walks up and down on the
left</i>]. To four boys, whom she happened
to be with. She has a craze for pure
boys, just like&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> A perfectly innocent <i>penchant</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite as innocent as playing
brother and sister when one is father
and mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You saw her, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes, of course; but you've
never seen her if you didn't see her then&mdash;I
mean, if you weren't present&mdash;and
that's the reason, don't you know, why a
husband can never know his wife. Have
you got her photograph?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>takes a photo out of his pocketbook.
Inquisitively</i>]. Here you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>takes it</i>]. Were you present
when it was taken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Just look at it? Is it like the
portrait you painted? No, the features
are the same, but the expression is different.
But you don't notice that, because
you insist on seeing in it the picture
of her which you've painted. Now
look at this picture as a painter, without
thinking of the original. What does it
represent? I can see nothing but a
tricked-out flirt, playing the decoy. Observe
the cynical twist in the mouth,
which you never managed to see. You
see that her look is seeking a man quite
different from you. Observe the dress
is <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>, the coiffure titivated to the
last degree, the sleeves finished high up.
You see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, now I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Be careful, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>gives him back the portrait</i>].
Of her revenge. Don't forget that by
saying she was no longer attractive to
men you wounded her in the one thing
which she took most seriously. If you'd
called her literary works twaddle she'd
have laughed, and pitied your bad taste,
but now&mdash;take it from me&mdash;if she hasn't
avenged herself already it's not her fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I must be clear on that point.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes over to Gustav, and sits
down in his previous place. Gustav
approaches him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Find out yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Find out myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Investigate. I'll help you,
if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Good. Since
I've been condemned to death once&mdash;so
be it&mdash;sooner or later it's all the same
what's to happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> One question first. Hasn't
your wife got just one weak point?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Not that I know of. [<i>Adolf
goes to the open door in the center</i>]. Yes.
You can hear the steamer in the Sound
now&mdash;she'll be here soon. And I must
go down to meet her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>holding him back</i>]. No, stay
here. Be rude to her. If she's got a
good conscience she'll let you have it so
hot and strong that you won't know
where you are. But if she feels guilty
she'll come and caress you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Are you so sure of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Not absolutely. At times a
hare goes back in the tracks, but I'm not
going to let this one escape me. My
room is just here. [<i>Points to the door
on the right and goes behind Adolf's
chair.</i>] I'll keep this position, and be on
the look-out, while you play your game
here, and when you've played it to the end
we'll exchange parts. I'll go in the cage
and leave myself to the tender mercies
of the snake, and you can stand at the
keyhole. Afterwards we'll meet in the
park and compare notes. But pull yourself
together, old man, and if you show
weakness I'll knock on the floor twice
with a chair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. Right. But don't
go away: I must know that you're in the
next room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You can trust me for that.
But be careful you aren't afraid when
you see later on how I can dissect a
human soul and lay the entrails here on
the table. It may seem a bit uncanny
to beginners, but if you've seen it done
once you don't regret it. One thing more,
don't say a word that you've met me, or
that you have made any acquaintance
during her absence&mdash;not a word. I'll
ferret out her weak point myself. Hush!
She's already up there in her room. She's
whistling&mdash;then she's in a temper. Now
stick to it. [<i>He points to the left.</i>] And
sit here on this chair, then she'll have to
sit there [<i>He points to the sofa on the
left.</i>], and I can keep you both in view
at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> We've still got an hour before
dinner. There are no new visitors, for
there has been no bell to announce them.
We'll be alone together&mdash;more's the pity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You seem pretty limp. Are
you unwell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I'm all right; unless, you
know, I'm frightened of what's going to
happen. But I can't help its happening.
The stone rolls, but it was not the last
drop of water that made it roll, nor yet
the first&mdash;everything taken together
brought it about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Let it roll, then; it won't have
any peace until it does. Good-by, for
the time being.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit on the right. Adolf nods to
him, stands up for a short time,
looking at the photograph, tears it
to pieces, and throws the fragments
behind the circular table on the

his tie, runs his fingers through his
hair, fumbles with the lapels of his
coat, etc. Thekla enters on the

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>frank, cheerful and engaging,
goes straight up to her husband and
kisses him</i>]. Good-day, little brother;
how have you been getting on?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stands on his left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>half overcome but jocularly resisting</i>].
What mischief have you been
up to, for you to kiss me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Yes, let me just confess.
Something very naughty&mdash;I've spent an
awful lot of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Did you have a good time,
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Excellent. [<i>She goes to his
right.</i>] But not at the Congress. It was
as dull as ditch-water, don't you know.
But how has little brother been passing
the time, when his little dove had flown
away?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She looks around the room, as
though looking for somebody or
scenting something, and thus comes
behind the sofa on the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh, the time seemed awfully
long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Nobody to visit you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Not a soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>looks him up and down and
sits down on the sofa</i>]. Who sat here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Here? No one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Strange! The sofa is as
warm as anything, and there's the mark
of an elbow in the cushion. Have you
had a lady visitor?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stands up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Me? You're not serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>turns away from the square
table and comes to Adolf's right</i>]. How
he blushes! So the little brother wants
to mystify me a bit, does he? Well, let
him come here and confess what he's got
on his conscience to his little wife.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She draws him to her. Adolf lets
his head sink on her breast; laughing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You're a regular devil, do you
know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, I know myself so little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Do you never think about
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>looking in the air, while she
looks at him searchingly</i>]. About myself?
I only think about myself. I am
a shocking egoist, but how philosophical
you've become, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Put your hand on my forehead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>playfully</i>]. Has he got bees
in his bonnet again? Shall I drive them
away? [<i>She kisses him on the forehead.</i>]
There, it's all right now? [<i>Pause, moving
away from him to the right.</i>] Now
let me hear what he's been doing to
amuse himself. Painted anything pretty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No; I've given up painting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What, you've given up painting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, but don't scold me about
it. How could I help it if I wasn't able
to paint any more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What are you going to take
up then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I'm going to be a sculptor.
[<i>Thekla passes over in front of the square
table and in front of the sofa.</i>] Yes, but
don't blame me&mdash;just look at this figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>unwraps the figure on the
table</i>]. Hallo, I say. Who's this meant
to be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Guess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. Is it meant to be
his little wife? And he isn't ashamed of
it, is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Hasn't he hit the mark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> How can I tell?&mdash;the face
is lacking.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She drapes the figure.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Quite so&mdash;but all the rest?
Nice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>taps him caressingly on yhe
cheek</i>]. Will he shut up? Otherwise
I'll kiss him.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes behind him; Adolf defending
himself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Look out, look out, anybody
might come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>nestling close to him</i>]. What
do I care! I'm surely allowed to kiss
my own husband. That's only my legal
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Quite so; but do you know the
people here in the hotel take the view
that we're not married because we kiss
each other so much, and our occasional
quarreling makes them all the more cocksure
about it, because lovers usually carry
on like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> But need there be any quarrels?
Can't he always be as sweet and
good as he is at present. Let him tell
me. Wouldn't he like it himself?
Wouldn't he like us to be happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I should like it, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>with a step to the right</i>].
Who put it into his head not to paint any
more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You're always scenting somebody
behind me and my thoughts. You're
jealous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I certainly am. I was always
afraid some one might estrange you
from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You're afraid of that, you say,
though you know very well that there
isn't a woman living who can supplant
you&mdash;that I can't live without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I wasn't frightened the least
bit of females. It was your friends I
was afraid of: they put all kinds of ideas
into your head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>probing</i>]. So you were afraid?
What were you afraid of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Some one has been here.
Who was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Can't you stand my looking at
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Not in that way. You aren't
accustomed to look at me like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> How am I looking at you then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You are spying underneath
your eyelids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Right through. Yes, I want
to know what it's like inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I don't mind. As you like.
I've nothing to hide, but&mdash;your very
manner of speaking has changed&mdash;you
employ expressions. [<i>Probing.</i>] You
philosophize. Eh? [<i>She goes toward him
in a menacing manner.</i>] Who has been
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> My doctor&mdash;nobody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Your doctor! What doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> The doctor from Str&ouml;mastad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What's his name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Sj&ouml;berg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Well&mdash;he said, among other
things&mdash;that I'm pretty near getting
epilepsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>with a step to the right</i>].
Among other things! What else did he
say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh, something extremely unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Let me hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> He forbade us to live together
as man and wife for some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> There you are. I thought as
much. They want to separate us. I've
already noticed it for some time.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes round the circular table
toward the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> There was nothing for you to
notice. There was never the slightest
incident of that description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> How could it have been possible
for you to have seen something
which wasn't there if your fear hadn't
heated your imagination to so violent a
pitch that you saw what never existed?
As a matter of fact, what were you afraid
of? That I might borrow another's eye
so as to see you as you really were, not
as you appeared to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Keep your imagination in
check, Adolf. Imagination is the beast
in the human soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Where did you get this wisdom
from? From the pure youths on the
steamer, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>without losing her self-possession</i>].
Certainly&mdash;even youth can
teach one a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You seem for once in a way,
to be awfully keen on youth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>standing by the door in the
center</i>]. I have always been so, and
that's how it came about that I loved
you. Any objection?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Not at all. But I should very
much prefer to be the only one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>coming forward on his right,
and joking as though speaking to a child</i>].
Let the little brother look here. I've got
such a large heart that there is room in it
for a great many, not only for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But little brother doesn't want
to know anything about the other brothers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Won't he just come here and
let himself be teased by his little woman,
because he's jealous&mdash;no, envious is the
right word.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Two knocks with a chair are heard
from the room on the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I don't want to fool about,
I want to speak seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>as though speaking to a child</i>].
Good Lord! he wants to speak seriously.
Upon my word! Has the man become
serious for once in his life? [<i>Comes on
his left, takes hold of his head and kisses
him.</i>] Won't he laugh now a little?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Adolf laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> There, there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>laughs involuntarily</i>]. You
damned witch, you! I really believe you
can bewitch people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>comes in front of the sofa</i>].
He can see for himself, and that's why
he mustn't worry me, otherwise I shall
certainly bewitch him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>springs up</i>]. Thekla! Sit for
me a minute in profile, and I'll do the
face for your figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> With pleasure.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She turns her profile toward him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>sits down, fixes her with his
eyes and acts as though he were modeling</i>].
Now, don't think of me, think of
somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I'll think of my last conquest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> The pure youth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Quite right. He had the
duckiest, sweetest little mustache, and
cheeks like cherries, so delicate and
soft, one could have bitten right into
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>depressed</i>]. Just keep that
twist in your mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What twist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> That cynical insolent twist
which I've never seen before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>makes a grimace</i>]. Like
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Quite. [<i>He gets up.</i>] Do
you know how Bret Harte describes the
adulteress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>laughs</i>]. No, I've never read
that Bret What-do-you-call-him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh! she's a pale woman who
never blushes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Never? Oh yes, she does;
oh yes, she does. Perhaps when she
meets her lover, even though her husband
and Mr. Bret didn't manage to see anything
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Are you so certain about
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>as before</i>]. Absolutely. If
the man isn't able to drive her very blood
to her head, how can he possibly enjoy
the pretty spectacle?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She passes by him toward the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>raving</i>]. Thekla! Thekla!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Little fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Thekla!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Let him call me his own dear
little sweetheart, and I'll get red all over
before him, shall I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>disarmed</i>]. I'm so angry with
you, you monster, that I should like to
bite you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She holds out her arms towards

her</i>]. Yes, my dear, I'll bite you so that
you die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>joking</i>]. Look out, somebody
might come.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes to the fireplace on the
right and leans on the chimneypiece.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Oh, what do I care if they do.
I don't care about anything in the whole
world so long as I have you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And if you don't have me
any more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>sinks down on the chair on the
left in front of the circular table</i>]. Then
I die!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> All right, you needn't be
frightened of that the least bit; I'm already
much too old, you see, for anybody
to like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You haven't forgotten those
words of mine?&mdash;I take them back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Can you explain to me why
it is that you're so jealous, and at the
same time so sure of yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I can't explain it, but it
may be that the thought that another
man has possessed you, gnaws and consumes
me. It seems to me at times as
though our whole love were a figment of
the brain&mdash;a passion that had turned
into a formal matter of honor. I know
nothing which would be more intolerable
for me to bear, than for him to have the
satisfaction of making me unhappy. Ah,
I've never seen him, but the very thought
that there is such a man who watches in
secret for my unhappiness, who conjures
down on me the curse of heaven day by
day, who would laugh and gloat over my
fall&mdash;the very idea of the thing lies
like a nightmare on my breast, drives me
to you, holds me spellbound, cripples
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>goes behind the circular table
and comes on Adolf's right</i>]. Do you
think I should like to give him that satisfaction,
that I should like to make his
prophecy come true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I won't believe that of
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Then if that's so, why aren't
you easy on the subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> It's your flirtations which keep
me in a chronic state of agitation. Why
do you go on playing that game?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> It's no game. I want to be
liked, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Quite so; but only liked by
men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Of course. Do you suggest
it would be possible for one of us women
to get herself liked by other women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I say. [<i>Pause.</i>] Haven't you
heard recently&mdash;from him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Not for the last six months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Do you never think of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>after a pause, quickly and
tonelessly</i>]. No. [<i>With a step toward
the left.</i>] Since the death of the child
there is no longer any tie between us.
[<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And you never see him in the
street?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No; he must have buried
himself somewhere on the west coast.
But why do you harp on that subject just
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I don't know. When I was so
alone these last few days, it just occurred
to me what he must have felt like when
he was left stranded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I believe you've got pangs
of conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You think you're a thief,
don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Pretty near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> All right. You steal women
like you steal children or fowl. You regard
me to some extent like his real or
personal property. Much obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No; I regard you as his wife,
and that's more than property: it can't
be made up in damages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Oh yes, it can. If you happen
to hear one fine day that he has married
again, these whims and fancies of
yours will disappear. [<i>She comes over
to him.</i>] Haven't you made up for him
to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Have I?&mdash;and did you use to
love him in those days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>goes behind him to the fireplace
on the right</i>]. Of course I loved
him&mdash;certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I got tired of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And just think, if you get
tired of me in the same way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> That will never be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But suppose another man came
along with all the qualities that you want
in a man? Assume the hypothesis,
wouldn't you leave me in that case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> If he riveted you to him so
strongly that you couldn't be parted
from him, then of course you'd give me
up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No; I have never yet said
anything like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But you can't love two people
at the same time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Oh yes. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I can't understand it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Is anything then impossible
simply because you can't understand it?
All men are not made on the same lines,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>getting up a few steps to the
left</i>]. I am now beginning to understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>sits down in his previous place
by the square table</i>]. No, really?
[<i>Pause, during which he appears to be
making an effort to remember something,
but without success.</i>] Thekla, do you
know that your frankness is beginning to
be positively agonizing? [<i>Thekla moves
away from him behind the square table
and goes behind the sofa on the left.</i>]
Haven't you told me, times out of number,
that frankness is the most beautiful
virtue you know, and that I must spend
all my time in acquiring it? But it
seems to me you take cover behind your
frankness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Those are the new tactics,
don't you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. I don't know
how it is, but this place begins to feel uncanny.
If you don't mind, we'll travel
home this very night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What an idea you've got into
your head again. I've just arrived, and
I've no wish to travel off again.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She sits down on the sofa on the
left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> But if I want it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Nonsense! What do I care
what you want? Travel alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>seriously</i>]. I now order you
to travel with me by the next steamer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Order? What do you mean
by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Do you forget that you're my
wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. Do you forget
that you're my husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>following her example</i>]. That's
just the difference between one sex and
the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> That's right, speak in that
tone&mdash;you have never loved me.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes past him to the right up
to the fireplace.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, for loving means giving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> For a man to love means giving,
for a woman to love means taking&mdash;and
I've given, given, given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Oh, to be sure, you've given
a fine lot, haven't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>leans on the chimneypiece</i>].
There has been a great deal besides that.
And even if you did give me everything,
I accepted it. What do you mean by
coming now and handing the bill for
your presents? If I did take them, I
proved to you by that very fact that I
loved you. [<i>She approaches him.</i>] A
girl only takes presents from her lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> From her lover, I agree. There
you spoke the truth. [<i>With a step to the
left.</i>] I was just your lover, but never
your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> A man ought to be jolly
grateful when he's spared the necessity
of playing cover, but if you aren't satisfied
with the position you can have your
<i>cong&eacute;</i>. I don't like a husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, I noticed as much, for
when I remarked, some time back, that
you wanted to sneak away from me, and
get a set of your own, so as to be able
to deck yourself out with my feathers,
to scintillate with my jewels, I wanted to
remind you of your guilt. And then I
changed from your point of view into
that inconvenient creditor, whom a woman
would particularly prefer to keep at
a safe distance from one, and then you
would have liked to have canceled the
debt, and to avoid getting any more into
my debt; you ceased to pilfer my coffers
and transferred your attention to others.
I was your husband without having
wished it, and your hate began to arise;
but now I'm going to be your husband,
whether you want it or not. I can't be
your lover any more, that's certain!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He sits down in his previous place
on the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>half joking, she moves away
behind the table and goes behind the
sofa</i>]. Don't talk such nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You be careful! It's a dangerous
game, to consider every one else
an ass and only oneself smart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Everybody does that more
or less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> And I'm just beginning to suspect
that that husband of yours wasn't
such an ass after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Good God! I really believe
you're beginning to have sympathy&mdash;for
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, almost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Well, look here. Wouldn't
you like to make his acquaintance, so as
to pour out your heart to him if you
want to? What a charming picture!
But I, too, begin to feel myself drawn
to him somehow. I'm tired of being the
nurse of a baby like you. [<i>She goes a
few steps forward and passes by Adolf
on the right.</i>] He at any rate was a
man, even though he did make the mistake
of being my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Hush, hush! But don't talk
so loud, we might be heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What does it matter, so long
as we're taken for man and wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> So this is what it comes to
then? You are now beginning to be
keen both on manly men and pure boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> There are no limits to my
keenness, as you see. And my heart is
open to the whole world, great and small,
beautiful and ugly. I love the whole
world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>standing up</i>]. Do you know
what that means?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, I don't know, I only
feel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> It means that old age has arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Are you starting on that
again now? Take care!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> You take care!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Of this knife.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Goes towards her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>flippantly</i>]. Little brother
shouldn't play with such dangerous toys.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She passes by him behind the sofa.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I'm not playing any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>leaning on the arm of the
sofa</i>]. Really, he's serious, is he, quite
serious? Then I'll jolly well show you&mdash;that
you made a mistake. I mean&mdash;you'll
never see it yourself, you'll never
know it. The whole world will be up to
it, but you jolly well won't, you'll have
suspicions and surmises and you won't
enjoy a single hour of peace. You will
have the consciousness of being ridiculous
and of being deceived, but you'll never
have proofs in your hand, because a husband
never manages to get them. [<i>She
makes a few steps to the right in front
of him and toward him.</i>] That will teach
you to know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>sits down in his previous place
by the table on the left</i>]. You hate me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, I don't hate you, nor do
I think that I could ever get to hate you.
Simply because you're a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Listen to me! Just think of
the time when the storm broke over us.
[<i>Standing up.</i>] You lay there like a
new-born child and shrieked; you caught
hold of my knees and I had to kiss your
eyes to sleep. Then I was your nurse,
and I had to be careful that you didn't
go out into the street without doing your
hair. I had to send your boots to the
shoe-maker. I had to take care there
was something in the larder. I had to
sit by your side and hold your hand in
mine by the hour, for you were frightened,
frightened of the whole world, deserted
by your friends, crushed by public
opinion. I had to cheer you up till my
tongue stuck to my palate and my head
ached; I had to pose as a strong man,
and compel myself to believe in the future,
until at length I succeeded in
breathing life into you while you lay
there like the dead. Then it was I you
admired, then it was I who was the man;
not the athlete like the man you deserted,
but the man of psychic strength, the man
of magnetism, who transferred his moral
force into your enervated muscles and
filled your empty brain with new electricity.
And then I put you on your feet
again, got a small court for you, whom
I jockeyed into admiring you, as a sheer
matter of friendship to myself, and I
made you mistress over me and my home.
I painted you in my finest pictures, in
rose and azure on a ground of gold, and
there was no exhibition in which you
didn't have the place of honor. At one
moment you were called St. Cecelia, then
you were Mary Stuart, Karm Mansdotter,
Ebba Brahe, and so I succeeded in awakening
and stimulating your interests and
so I compelled the yelping rabble to look
at you with my own dazzled eyes. I impressed
your personality on them by sheer
force. I compelled them until you had
won their overwhelming sympathy&mdash;so
that at last you have the free <i>entr&eacute;e</i>.
And when I had created you in this way
it was all up with my own strength&mdash;I
broke down, exhausted by the strain.
[<i>He sits down in his previous place.
Thekla turns toward the fireplace on the
right.</i>] I had lifted you up, but at the
same time I brought myself down; I fell
ill; and my illness began to bore you, just
because things were beginning to look a
bit rosy for you&mdash;and then it seemed
to me many times as though some secret
desire were driving you to get away
from your creditor and accomplice. Your
love became that of a superior sister, and
through want of a better part I fell into
the habit of the new r&ocirc;le of the little
brother. Your tenderness remained the
same as ever, in fact it has rather increased,
but it is tinged with a grain of
pity which is counterbalanced by a strong
dose of contempt, and that will increase
until it becomes complete, even as my
genius is on the wane and your star is in
the ascendant. It seems, too, as though
your source were likely to dry up, when
I leave off feeding it, or, rather, as soon
as you show that you don't want to draw
your inspiration from me any longer.
And so we both go down, but you need
somebody you can put in your pocket,
somebody new, for you are weak and incapable
of carrying any moral burden
yourself. So I became the scapegoat to
be slaughtered alive, but all the same
we had become like twins in the course
of years, and when you cut through the
thread of my longing, you little thought
that you were throttling our own self.
You are a branch from my tree, and you
wanted to cut yourself free from your
parent stem before it had struck roots,
but you are unable to flourish on your
own, and the tree in its turn couldn't do
without its chief branch, and so both
perish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Do you mean, by all that,
that you've written my books?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No; you say that so as to provoke
me into a lie. I don't express myself
so crudely as you, and I've just
spoken for five minutes on end simply
so as to reproduce all the nuances,
all the half-tones, all the transitions,
but your barrel organ has only one
key.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>walking up and down on the
right</i>]. Yes, yes; but the gist of the
whole thing is that you've written my
books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> No, there's no gist. You can't
resolve a symphony into one key; you
can't translate a multifarious life into a
single cipher. I never said anything so
crass as that I'd written your books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> But you meant it all the
same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>furious</i>]. I never meant it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> But the result&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. There's no result if
one doesn't add. There is a quotient, a
long infinitesimal figure of a quotient,
but I didn't add.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You didn't, but I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I quite believe you, but I never
did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> But you wanted to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>exhausted, shutting his eyes</i>].
No, no, no&mdash;don't speak to me any more,
I'm getting convulsions&mdash;be quiet, go
away! You're flaying my brain with
your brutal pinchers&mdash;you're thrusting
your claws into my thoughts and tearing
them.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He loses consciousness, stares in
front of him and turns his thumbs

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>tenderly coming towards
him</i>]. What is it, dear? Are you ill?
[<i>Adolf beats around him. Thekla takes
her handkerchief, pours water on to it

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>he shakes his head</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Do you see now that you
were wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Yes, yes, yes&mdash;I
see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And you ask me to forgive
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Yes, yes, yes&mdash;I ask you to
forgive me; but don't talk right into my
brain any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Now kiss my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> I'll kiss your hand, if only you
won't speak to me any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And now you'll go out and
get some fresh air before dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. Yes, that will do
me good, and afterwards we'll pack up
and go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She moves away from him up to the
fireplace on the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Why not? You must have
some reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> The simple reason that I've
arranged to be at the reception this
evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> That's it, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> That's it right enough. I've
promised to be there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Promised? You probably said
that you'd try to come; it doesn't prevent
you from explaining that you have given
up your intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, I'm not like you: my
word is binding on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> One's word can be binding
without one being obliged to respect every
casual thing one lets fall in conversation;
or did somebody make you promise that
you'd go? In that case, you can ask him
to release you because your husband is
ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No, I've no inclination to do
so. And, besides, you're not so ill that
you can't quite well come along too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Why must I always come along
too? Does it contribute to your greater
serenity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I don't understand what you
mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> That's what you always say
when you know I mean something which
you don't like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Re-a-lly? And why shouldn't
I like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf.</span> Stop! stop! Don't start all
over again&mdash;good-by for the present&mdash;I'll
be back soon; I hope that in the
meanwhile you'll have thought better of
it.</p>

Gustav.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But you, on the other hand,
my dear Thekla, are still quite as fascinating
as ever&mdash;almost younger, in fact.
Please forgive me. I wouldn't for anything
disturb your happiness by my presence.
If I'd known that you were staying
here I would never have&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Please&mdash;please, stay. It
may be that you find it painful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> It's all right as far as I'm

I said I should always have to run
the risk of wounding you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>passes in front of him toward

you don't wound me, because you

tactful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You're too kind; but how on
earth can one tell if&mdash;your husband
would regard me in the same light that
you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Quite the contrary. Why,
he's just been expressing himself with
the utmost sympathy with regard to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Ah! Yes, everything dies
away, even the names which we cut on
the tree's bark&mdash;not even malice can persist
for long in these temperaments of
ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> He's never entertained malice
against you&mdash;why, he doesn't know
you at all&mdash;and, so far as I'm concerned,
I always entertained the silent hope that
I would live to see the time in which
you would approach each other as friends&mdash;or
at least meet each other in my
presence, shake hands, and part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> It was also my secret desire
to see the woman whom I loved more
than my life in really good hands, and,
as a matter of fact, I've only heard the
very best account of him, while I know
all his work as well. All the same, I
felt the need of pressing his hand before
I grew old, looking him in the face, and
asking him to preserve the treasure which
providence had entrusted to him, and at
the same time I wanted to extinguish the
hate which was burning inside me, quite
against my will, and I longed to find
peace of soul and resignation, so as to be
able to finish in quiet that dismal portion
of my life which is still left me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Your words come straight
from your heart; you have understood
me, Gustav&mdash;thanks.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She holds out her hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Ah, I'm a petty man. Too
insignificant to allow of your thriving in
my shadow. Your temperament, with
its thirst for freedom, could not be satisfied
by my monotonous life, the slavish
routine to which I was condemned, the
narrow circle in which I had to move.
I appreciate that, but you understand
well enough&mdash;you who are such an expert
psychologist&mdash;what a struggle it
must have cost me to acknowledge that
to myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> How noble, how great to acknowledge
one's weaknesses so frankly&mdash;it's
not all men who can bring themselves
to that point. [<i>She sighs.</i>] But
you are always an honest character,
straight and reliable&mdash;which I knew how
to respect,&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I wasn't&mdash;not then, but suffering
purges, care ennobles and&mdash;and&mdash;I
have suffered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>comes nearer to him</i>]. Poor
Gustav, can you forgive me, can you?
Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Forgive? What? It is I who
have to ask you for forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>striking another key</i>]. I do
believe that we're both crying&mdash;though
we're neither of us chickens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>softly sliding into another
tone</i>]. Chickens, indeed! I'm an old
man, but you&mdash;you're getting younger
every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Do you mean it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And how well you know how
to dress!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> It was you and no one else
who taught me that. Do you still remember
finding out my special colors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> It was quite simple, don't
you remember? Come, I still remember
distinctly how angry you used to be with
me if I ever had anything else except
pink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I angry with you? I was
never angry with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Oh yes, you were, when you
wanted to teach me how to think. Don't
you remember? And I wasn't able to
catch on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Not able to think, everybody
can think, and now you're developing a
quite extraordinary power of penetration&mdash;at
any rate in your writings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>disagreeably affected, tries to
change the subject quickly</i>]. Yes, Gustav
dear, I was really awfully glad to see
you again, especially under circumstances
so unemotional.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, you can't say at any
rate that I was such a cantankerous cuss:
taking it all round, you had a pretty
quiet time of it with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Yes; if anything too quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Really? But I thought, don't
you see, that you wanted me to be quiet
and nothing else. Judging by your expressions
of opinion as a bride, I had to
come to that assumption.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> How could a woman know
then what she really wanted? Besides,
mother had always drilled into me to
make the best of myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, and that's why it is that
you're going as strong as possible.
There's such a lot always doing in artist
life&mdash;your husband isn't exactly a home-bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> But even so one can have
too much of a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>suddenly changing his tone</i>].
Why, I do believe you're still wearing my
earrings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Yes, why
shouldn't I? We're not enemies, you
know&mdash;and then I thought I would wear
them as a symbol that we're not enemies&mdash;besides,
you know that earrings like
this aren't to be had any more.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She takes one off.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, so far so good; but
what does your husband say on the
point?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Why should I ask him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You don't ask him? But
that's rubbing it in a bit too much&mdash;it
could quite well make him look ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>simply&mdash;in an undertone</i>].
If it only weren't so pretty.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She has some trouble in adjusting
the earring.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>who has noticed it</i>]. Perhaps
you will allow me to help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Oh, if you would be so kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>presses it into the ear</i>].
Little ear! I say, dear, supposing your
husband saw us now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Then there'd be a scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Is he jealous, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I should think he is&mdash;rather!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Noise in the room on the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>passes in front of her toward
the right</i>]. Whose room is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>stepping a little toward the
left</i>]. I don't know&mdash;tell me how you
are now, and what you're doing.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes to the table on the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You tell me how you are.
[<i>He goes behind the square table on the
left, over to the sofa.&mdash;Thekla, embarrassed,
takes the cloth off the figure absent-mindedly.</i>]
No! who is that? Why&mdash;it's you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I don't think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> But it looks like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>cynically</i>]. You think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>sits down on the sofa</i>]. It reminds
one of the anecdote: "How could
your Majesty say that?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>laughs loudly and sits down
opposite him on the settee</i>]. What foolish
ideas you do get into your head.
Have you got by any chance some new
yarns?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No; but you must know some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I don't get a chance any
more now of hearing anything which is
really funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Is he as prudish as all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Rather!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Never different?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> He's been so ill lately.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Both stand up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, who told little brother
to walk into somebody else's wasps' nest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>laughs</i>]. Foolish fellow, you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Poor child! do you still remember
that once, shortly after our engagement,
we lived in this very room,
eh? But then it was furnished differently,
there was a secretary for instance,
here, by the pillar, and the bed [<i>With
delicacy.</i>] was here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Hush!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Look at me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> If you would like me to.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They keep their eyes looking into
each other's for a minute.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Do you think it is possible to
forget a thing which has made so deep
an impression on one's life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> No; the power of impressions
is great, particularly when they are
the impressions of one's youth.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She turns toward the fireplace on
her right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Do you remember how we met
for the first time? You were such an
ethereal little thing, a little slate on
which your parents and governess had
scratched some wretched scrawl, which
I had to rub out afterwards, and then I
wrote a new text on it, according to what
I thought right, till it seemed to you that
the slate was filled with writing. [<i>He
follows her to the circular table on the
right.</i>] That's why, do you see, I
shouldn't like to be in your husband's
place&mdash;no, that's his business. [<i>Sits
down in front of the circular table.</i>] But
that's why meeting you has an especial
fascination for me. We hit it off together
so perfectly, and when I sit down
here and chat with you it's just as though
I were uncorking bottles of old wine
which I myself have bottled. The wine
which is served to me is my own, but it
has mellowed. And now that I intend
to marry again, I have made a very careful
choice of a young girl whom I can
train according to my own ideas. [<i>Getting
up.</i>] For woman is man's child,
don't you know; if she isn't his child,
then he becomes hers, and that means
that the world is turned upside down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You're going to marry
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes. I'm going to try my
luck once more, but this time I'll jolly
well see that the double harness is more
reliable and shall know how to guard
against any bolting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>turns and goes over toward
him to the left</i>]. Is she pretty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Yes, according to my taste,
but perhaps I'm too old, and strangely
enough&mdash;now that chance brings me
near to you again&mdash;I'm now beginning
to have grave doubts of the feasibility of
playing a game like that twice over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I feel that my roots are too
firmly embedded in your soil, and the old
wounds break open. You're a dangerous
woman, Thekla.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Re-a-lly? My young husband
is emphatic that is just what I'm
not&mdash;that I can't make any more conquests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> That means he's left off loving
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What he means by love lies
outside my line of country.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes behind the sofa on the left.
Gustav goes after her as far as the
table on the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> You've played hide and seek
so long with each other that the "he"
can't catch the she, nor the she the "he,"
don't you know. Of course it's just the
kind of thing one would expect. You
had to play the little innocent, and that
makes him quite tame. As a matter of
fact a change has its disadvantages&mdash;yes,
it has its disadvantages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You reproach me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Not for a minute. What always
happens, happens with a certain
inevitability, and if this particular thing
hadn't happened something else would,
but this did happen, and here we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You're a broad-minded man.
I've never yet met anybody with whom
I liked so much to have a good straight
talk as with you. You have so little
patience with all that moralizing and
preaching, and you make such small demands
on people, that one feels really
free in your presence. Do you know
I'm jealous of your future wife?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She comes forward and passes by
him toward the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And you know I'm jealous
of your husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And now we must part!
Forever!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes past him till she approaches
the center door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite right, we must part&mdash;but
before that, we'll say good-by to
each other, won't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>uneasily</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>dogging her</i>]. Yes, we will;
yes, we will. We'll say good-by; we
will drown our memories in an ecstasy
which will be so violent that when we
wake up the past will have vanished from
our  recollection  forever. There  are
ecstasies like that, you know. [<i>He puts
his arm around her waist.</i>] You're being
dragged down by a sick spirit, who's
infecting you with his own consumption.
I will breathe new life into you. I will
fertilize your genius, so that it will bloom
in the autumn like a rose in the spring,
I will&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes behind the sofa on the

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You've robbed me of my
soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>comes forward</i>]. And I give
you mine in exchange for it. Besides,
you haven't got any soul at all. It's
only an optical illusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You've got a knack of being
rude in such a way that one can't be
angry with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> That's because you know very
well that I am designated for the place
of honor&mdash;tell me now when&mdash;and
where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>coming toward him</i>]. No.
I can't hurt him by doing a thing like
that. I'm sure he still loves me, and
I don't want to wound him a second
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> He doesn't love you. Do you
want to have proofs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> How can you give me them?</p>

when and where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> He goes away to-night by
the eight-o'clock boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> At nine. [<i>A noise in the
room on the right.</i>] Who's in there making
such a noise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>goes to the right at the keyhole</i>].
Let's have a look&mdash;the fancy
table has been upset and there's a broken
water-bottle on the floor, that's all. Perhaps
some one has shut a dog up there.
[<i>He goes again toward her.</i>] Nine
o'clock, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Right you are. I should
only like him to see the fun&mdash;such a
piece of deceit, and what's more, from a
man that's always preaching truthfulness,
who's always drilling into me to
speak the truth. But stop&mdash;how did
it all happen? He received me in almost
an unfriendly manner&mdash;didn't come to
the pier to meet me&mdash;then he let fall a
remark over the pure boy on the steam-boat,
which I pretended not to understand.
But how could he know anything
about it? Wait a moment. Then he began
to philosophize about women&mdash;then
you began to haunt his brain&mdash;then he
spoke about wanting to be a sculptor,
because sculpture was the art of the present
day&mdash;just like you used to thunder
in the old days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No, really?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Thekla moves away from Gustav
behind the sofa on the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> "No, really?" Now I understand.
[<i>To Gustav.</i>] Now at last I
see perfectly well what a miserable
scoundrel you are. You've been with
him and have scratched his heart out of
his body. It's you&mdash;you who've been
sitting here on the sofa. It was you
who've been suggesting all these ideas
to him: that he was suffering from epilepsy,
that he should live a celibate life,
that he should pit himself against his
wife and try to play her master. How
long have you been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Eight days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You were the man, then, I
saw on the steamer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>frankly</i>]. It was I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And did you really think
that I'd fall in with your little game?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. You've already done
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. Yes, you have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>comes forward</i>]. You've
stalked my lamb like a wolf. You came
here with a scoundrelly plan of smashing
up my happiness and you've been trying
to carry it through until I realize
what you were up to and put a spoke in
your precious wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>vigorously</i>]. That's not quite
accurate. The thing took quite another
course. That I should have wished in my
heart of hearts that things should go
badly with you is only natural. Yet I
was more or less convinced that it would
not be necessary for me to cut in actively;
because, I had far too much other business
to have time for intrigues. But just
now, when I was loafing about a bit, and
happened to run across you on the
steamer with your circle of young men,
I thought that the time had come to get
to slightly closer quarters with you two.
I came here and that lamb of yours threw
himself immediately into the wolf's arms.
I aroused his sympathy by methods of
reflex suggestion, into details of which,
as a matter of good form, I'd rather not
go. At first I experienced a certain pity
for him, because he was in the very condition
in which I had once found myself.
Then, as luck would have it, he began
unwittingly to probe about in my old
wound&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;the
book&mdash;and the ass&mdash;then I was overwhelmed
by a desire to pluck him to
pieces and to mess up the fragments in
such a tangle that they could never be
put together again. Thanks to the conscientious
way in which you have cleared
the ground, I succeeded only too easily,
and then I had to deal with you. You
were the spring in the works that had to
be taken to pieces. And, that done, the
game was to listen for the smash-up.
When I came into this room I had no idea
what I was to say. I had a lot of plans
in my head, like a chess player, but the
character of the opening depended on
the moves you made; one move led to another,
chance was kind to me. I soon
had you on toast&mdash;and now you're in a
nice mess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Oh yes; what you'd have
prayed your stars to avoid has happened:
society, in the persons of two lady visitors&mdash;I
didn't commandeer their appearance
because intrigue is not in my
line&mdash;society, I say, has seen your pathetic
reconciliation with your first husband,
and the penitent way in which you
crawled back into his faithful arms. Isn't
that enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>she goes over to him toward
the right</i>]. Tell me&mdash;you who make
such a point of being so logical and so
intellectual&mdash;how does it come about
that you, who make such a point of your
maxim that everything which happens
happens as a matter of necessity, and
that all our actions are determined&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>corrects her</i>]. Determined
up to a certain extent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> It comes to the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> How does it come about that
you, who are bound to regard me as an
innocent person, inasmuch as nature and
circumstances have driven me to act as
I did, could regard yourself as justified
in revenging yourself on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Well, the same principle applies,
you see&mdash;that is to say, the principle
that my temperament and circumstances
drove me to revenge myself.
Isn't it a case of six of one and half-a-dozen
of the other? But do you know
why you've got the worst of it in this
struggle? [<i>Thekla looks contemptuous.</i>]
Why you and that husband of yours managed
to get downed? I'll tell you. Because
I was stronger than you, and
smarter. It was you, my dear, who was
a donkey&mdash;and he as well! So you see
that one isn't necessarily bound to be
quite an ass even though one doesn't
write any novels or paint any pictures.
Just remember that!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns away from her to the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Haven't you got a grain of
feeling left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Not a grain&mdash;that's why,
don't you know, I'm so good at thinking,
as you are perhaps able to see by the
slight proofs which I've given you, and
can play the practical man equally well,
and I've just given you something of a
sample of what I can do in that line.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He strides round the table and sofa
on the left and turns again to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> And all this simply because
I wounded your vanity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>on her left</i>]. Not that only,
but you be jolly careful in the future of
wounding other people's vanity&mdash;it's the
most sensitive part of a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> What a vindictive wretch!
Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> What a promiscuous wretch.
Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Do you mean that's my temperament?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Do you mean that's my temperament?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>goes over toward him to the
left</i>]. You wouldn't like to forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Certainly, I have forgiven
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite. Have I ever raised
my hand against you two in all these
years? No. But when I happened to
be here I favored you two with scarce
a look and the cleavage between you is
already there. Did I ever reproach you,
moralize, lecture? No. I joked a little
with your husband and the accumulated
dynamite in him just happened to go off,
but I, who am defending myself like this,
am the one who's really entitled to stand
here and complain. Thekla, have you
nothing to reproach yourself with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Not the least bit&mdash;the
Christians say it's Providence that guides
our actions, others call it Fate, aren't
we quite guiltless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No doubt we are to a certain
extent. But an infinitesimal something
remains, and that contains the guilt, all
the same, and the creditors turn up sooner
or later! Men and women may be guiltless,
but they have to render an account.
Guiltless before Him in whom neither
of us believes any more, responsible to
themselves and to their fellow-men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You've come, then, to warn
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I've come to demand back
what you stole from me, not what you
had as a present. You stole my honor,
and I could only win back mine by taking
yours&mdash;wasn't I right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>after a pause, going over to
him on the right</i>]. Honor! Hm! And
are you satisfied now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. I am satisfied
now.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He presses the bell by the door L.
for the Waiter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>after another pause</i>]. And
now you're going to your bride, Gustav?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> I have none&mdash;and shall never
have one. I am not going home because
I have no home, and shall never have one.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Waiter comes in on the lef.</i>]</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene VI.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Previous characters&mdash;Waiter standing
back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Bring me the bill&mdash;I'm leaving
by the twelve-o'clock boat.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Waiter bows and exit left.</i>]</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene VII.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Without a reconciliation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>on her left</i>]. Reconciliation?
You play about with so many words
that they've quite lost their meaning.
We reconcile ourselves? Perhaps we are
to live in a trinity, are we? The way
for you to effect a reconciliation is to put
matters straight. You can't do that
alone. You have not only taken something,
but you have destroyed what you
took, and you can never put it back.
Would you be satisfied if I were to say to
you: "Forgive me because you mangled
my heart with your claws; forgive me
for the dishonor you brought upon me;
forgive me for being seven years on
end the laughing-stock of my pupils,
forgive me for freeing you from the control
of your parents; for releasing you
from the tyranny of ignorance and superstition;
for making you mistress over
my house; for giving you a position and
friends, I, the man who made you into a
woman out of the child you were? Forgive
me like I forgive you? Anyway, I
now regard my account with you as
squared. You go and settle up your accounts
with the other man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> Where is he? What have
you done with him? I've just got a suspicion&mdash;a&mdash;something
dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Done with him? Do you still
love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>goes over to him toward the
left</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> And a minute ago you loved
me? Is that really so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Do you know what you are,
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> You despise me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> No, I pity you. It's a characteristic&mdash;I
don't say a defect, but certainly
a characteristic&mdash;that is very
fatal, by reason of its results. Poor
Thekla! I don't know&mdash;but I almost
think that I'm sorry for it, although I'm
quite innocent&mdash;like you. But anyway
it's perhaps all for the best that you've
now got to feel what I felt then. Do
you know where your husband is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla.</span> I think I know now. [<i>She
points to the right.</i>] He's in your room
just here. He has heard everything,
seen everything, and you know they say
that he who looks upon his vampire
dies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene VIII.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Adolf appears on the right, deadly
pale, a streak of blood on his left cheek,
a fixed expression in his eyes, white foam
on his mouth.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav</span> [<i>moves back</i>]. No, here he is&mdash;settle
with him now! See if he'll be as
generous to you as I was. Good-by.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns to the left, stops after a
few steps, and remains standing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thekla</span> [<i>goes toward Adolf with outstretched
arms</i>]. Adolf! [<i>Adolf sinks
down in his chair by the table on the left.
Thekla throws herself over him and
caresses him.</i>] Adolf! My darling child,
are you alive? Speak! Speak! Forgive
your wicked Thekla! Forgive me! Forgive
me! Forgive me! Little brother
must answer. Does he hear? My God,
he doesn't hear me! He's dead! Good
God! O my God! Help! Help us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustav.</span> Quite true, she loves him as
well&mdash;poor creature!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>The room of Helms and Krakau in
the Old Men's Home. The time is afternoon
of a late September day. There is
a window at right looking out on the
street and another at left overlooking a
courtyard. There is a single door back
center which opens into a corridor on
both sides of which are similar doors in
long regular rows and at the end of which
is a stairway from the lower floors.</i></p>

<p><i>An imaginary line divides the room
into two equal parts. Helms lives on
the street side and Krakau on the side
nearest the courtyard. In each division
there is a bed, chiffonier, a cupboard, a
table, a sofa and several chairs. The
stove is on Krakau's side, but by way
of compensation Helms has an upholstered
arm chair with a tall back. A
lamp hangs in the exact center of the
ceiling.</i></p>

<p><i>Though there is a low screen which
can be used as partial partition between
the two divisions it is now folded and
standing against the back wall, and the
two tables are placed down center, end
to end, so that the place is for all present
purposes a single room.</i></p>

<p><i>Helms' side is conspicuously ill kept
and in disorder; Krakau's side is spick
and span. On Helms' table there is a
vase filled with flowers and near it a
pair of gray woolen socks and a pair of
heavy mittens. There is also a photograph
of a boy in a polished nickel standing-frame.</i></p>

<p><i>Helms, his spectacles on his nose, sits in
his great arm chair at the table and reads
a newspaper.</i></p>

<p><i>Krakau sits next to him working out
a problem on a chess board.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a short pause after the curtain
rises.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> There, I've done it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>without looking up from his
paper</i>]. It's easy enough if one cheats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Who cheats?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, year after year you
work out the same problem. Anybody
can do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>rearranging the chessmen</i>].
You can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Just try another problem
once, then see how smart you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I'm quite satisfied with this
one. [<i>Moves a piece.</i>] Going to have
chocolate to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. Chocolate!
What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I thought on account of it
being your birthday&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Chocolate! That's a drink
for women. On my birthday I serve
wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Hmmm! Wine, eh? Who's
coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Just one floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Bolling too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I suppose Buffe will bring him
along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> And he won't have a word
to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> He never has a word to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> No, never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Must you rattle those pieces
like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Can I help it if they are
heavy? [<i>Moves them more carefully.</i>]
You are always complaining about noise.
You only do it to remind me how well
you can hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Your hearing has gotten a
good deal worse this year, hasn't it?
Hansen says so, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Hansen! A lot he knows!
[<i>Moves a piece.</i>] Is there anything about
you in the paper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Nonsense! What should there
be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Your eightieth birthday.
They put all kinds of foolishness in the
papers these days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Didn't you hear what I said?
There is nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>regards him distrustfully over
his spectacles</i>]. Have you been reading
this paper while I was out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>loftily</i>]. I always read the
paper at night, you know. Newspaper
ought to be read by lamplight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Boasting about your eyesight
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes, I have excellent eyes.
[<i>Knocks solemnly on wood.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Did you read the "personal
notes"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. I told you I
haven't touched your old paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> My son-in-law has been appointed
postal inspector.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Postal Inspector! That's
not a very high office. I suppose that is
why Knut hasn't turned up to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>resentfully</i>]. You haven't congratulated
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Because he's a postal inspector?
Hump! Congratulations. [<i>Pushes
aside the chessboard and rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. Thanks. Ah, if
my daughter had lived, she would be
proud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>over his shoulder</i>]. If Mary's
gray cat had been a horse she could have
gone riding in the park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>regarding him sharply over his
glasses</i>]. Do you know what I have
noticed, Krakau? [<i>Krakau does not answer.</i>]
I have noticed that whenever I
mention my son-in-law you get mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> So?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>querulously</i>]. Yes you do. I
noticed it long ago. I don't see what
you've got against him. His son Knut is
your godson, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> We'll not talk about that,
Helms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> But I want to talk about it.
We have been friends for sixty years,
you and me, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. Why didn't Knut
send regards to me in his birthday letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Ha, you're jealous, that's what
you are. After all, it's my birthday, not
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> He never forgot to send regards
to <i>you</i> on <i>my</i> birthday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>beating his breast</i>]. Well, he's
my grandson and he's only your godson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>incredulously</i>]. So&mdash;e?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, isn't he your godson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Then why do you say so&mdash;e
like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>restraining himself</i>]. We'd
better not talk about that. I told you so
before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> But, damn it, I insist upon
talking about it. I want to know what
you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> That's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> It isn't the first time you've
made the same stupid remark.... Do
you mean to insinuate that he isn't my
grandson? Is that what you're driving
at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> For the third time, let's
drop the subject. [<i>Down in the courtyard
a hand organ begins to play.</i>]
There's the old organ grinder.... This
is Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You needn't tell me. I can
hear for myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> It's your turn to give him
something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I have no small change. Lay
it out for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Remember you owe me for
the pack of matches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> This will make seventeen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> [<i>Wraps a coin in a bit of
paper.</i>] I just want to make sure you've
got it right. You always argue about it
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Hmm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> [<i>Opens the window, throws
out the coin. The music plays more vigorously,
then suddenly stops.</i>] The porter
is chasing him away.... I suppose it's
because Larsen is sick downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>laughs angrily</i>]. Huh! You
were in an awful hurry about throwing
that money down, weren't you? Well, I
won't pay you for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>hastily closing the window</i>].
What kind of a way is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You should have waited until
he'd played a few tunes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> How was I going to know
the porter would chase him away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> That's your lookout. You
should have waited, then you would have
seen, I won't pay you back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> You're a damned old swindler,
Helms, and you always were. [<i>Turns
away and pulls out his pipe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>sees the pipe</i>]. I can't bear
tobacco smoke to-day; my throat's too
bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Let me tell you something;
I take no orders from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I'll complain to the superintendent.
Smoke hurts my throat, and you
know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Huh! Won't you complain
to your postal clerk son-in-law, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> No, but I'll tell Knut when
he comes. I don't see why I let you be
his godfather anyway. They wanted
some one else, but I said: "No, let's ask
Krakau; it will please him." I was a
fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> You asked me because you
knew I'd give him a handsome present.
Old miser that you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> But you've always been jealous
because I am his grandfather while
you are only his godfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> So&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>furious</i>]. Don't you dare to
smoke, do you hear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Who's smoking? [<i>Puts the
pipe back in his pocket.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You needn't pretend you are
not jealous. Why, when my daughter
was alive and came to visit me here you
used to crawl over to your own side and
hide your envious face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> She didn't come to see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, you might at least have
been polite.... But you were always a
false friend. You never forgave me for
having a wife and family while you were
a lonely old bachelor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> So&mdash;e!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Don't make that nasty noise!
It's true; you know it's true. To this day
I remember how angry you were when
Andrea was born. For two years you
didn't set foot in my house. You said
you couldn't bear children about....
But if she had been your own child&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Can't you talk about anything
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And you wouldn't come to my
wife's funeral either. I shall never forgive
you that, Krakau,&mdash;the wife of your
best friend&mdash;and now you want to smoke
though you know I have a weak throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Why will you talk like an
idiot? Don't you see the pipe is in my
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, you were going to
smoke, weren't you? And there's another
thing: It never occurred to you to congratulate
me when I told you my son-in-law
had been made a postal clerk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. I do congratulate
you. But you needn't be so stuck up
about it. He's not the only postal inspector
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Who's stuck up? Not a bit
of it! I was thinking of Knut. He'll be
better provided for now his father has a
good position. Isn't it natural for me
to think of Knut's welfare? I am his
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> So&mdash;o?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> There you go again with your
So&mdash;o! My daughter's son is my grandson.
Any fool knows that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Many a fool has believed he
was a daughter's father&mdash;and wasn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> What's that? My daughter...?
You are an idiot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Do you remember what happened
to Adam Harbee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> That has nothing to do with
the case. My wife was not that sort of a
woman. You'll concede that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Ye-es.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, then&mdash;but what can an
innocent old bachelor like you know of
such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Are you going to talk stuck
up again, Helms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Sure I will: I am too stuck
up to let an ignorant bachelor like you
teach me what's what about married life.
What do you know about it? Virgin!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>infuriated</i>]. I'll tell you
what I know about it. You are not Andrea's
father at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>laughs incredulously</i>]. Ain't
I? Well, if I may take the liberty to
ask, who is her father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> That's all right. We'll not
talk about it any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Oh yes, we will! Who is her
father, if I am not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> That's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Just empty talk, eh? I might
have known it. You just say such things
because I owe you seventeen pfennig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Twenty-seven! I laid out
ten for cake last Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Twenty-seven, then. And
that's why you make up these stories to
annoy me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span>. Have it your way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>whimpering</i>]. Why don't you
speak out, then? If I am not Andrea's
father, who is? You can't leave it like
this. Who is the man you accuse, eh?
Was it Axel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Or Summensen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Do you suppose Caroline
would mix up with a couple of swine like
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Of course I don't. It's you
that's been putting such things in my
head. You don't know what you are
talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I know what I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>pounds on the table</i>]. Who
was he then? Speak up or admit that
you are a filthy liar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>with sudden determination</i>].
I was her father. Now you know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>derisively</i>]. You!... Ha, ha,
ha!... You! God knows how you hit
on that idea. Do tell us about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>savagely; he is on his own
side of the room now</i>]. Yes, I'll tell you
about it.... With pleasure, my dear
Helms!... I had made up my mind to
carry the secret with me to the grave ...
but I can't stand your overbearing ways
any more.... Now it comes out....
And thank God for it.... You were a
devil to your wife and you have been a
devil to me, Helms, all the fifteen years
we have lived in this room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Ha, ha! So I've been a devil,
eh? The things one lives and learns!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes, a devil&mdash;a devil on
wheels. You whine and crow and fuss
and scold ... nothing suits you ... no
matter how hard I try ... and you are
mean and niggardly.... Every pfennig
must be pulled out of you like a tooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I don't throw my money in
the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Nobody throws his money in
the street, but you can't get along without
spending money, can you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> No, but you expected Caroline
to. Instead of money you gave her
compliments. Naturally she came to me
for help. She had to have pin money
and clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And you gave her money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Of course I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Yes, what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Of course it was humiliating
to her. She was very unhappy. I did
my best to console her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And then Andrea was born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. That was ... that
was powerful consolation, Krakau, I must
say.... But tell me how you are so sure
that Andrea was your daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Caroline told me herself.
Besides, didn't I know that she had lived
with you ten years before and never had
a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>pathetically</i>]. No. [<i>With a
flash of anger.</i>] Why didn't you tell me
this before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>who is half sorry now</i>].
Why should I have told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>without heeding him; mumbles
half to himself, shaking his head</i>]. And
if she was your daughter, then Knut is
your grandson and you are also his godfather
... and to me he is nothing [<i>bows
his head</i>]. I am eighty years old to-day,
Krakau.... It is hard to be told such
a thing when you are eighty....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>has gone over to him, sympathetically
touching his shoulder</i>]. I'm
sorry, Helms. I wish I hadn't told you.
But you made me so angry it just popped
out.... But don't worry ... everything
will be just the same as before&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>shakes his head mournfully</i>].
No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> But yes! I don't want him
all for myself. We can share him, can't
we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Share him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Of course. Instead of being
your grandson Knut will be <i>our</i> grandson,
that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>sits up proudly</i>]. Knut is
nothing to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> But nobody knows that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> He is a perfect stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> But nobody knows it except
you and me&mdash;don't you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You would throw it up to me
every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Never! We should be equal
partners. And oh, the long talks we
could have about him!... Before it was
different ... you were so stuck up about
your grandson, I couldn't bear it any
longer.... But now we can both be
stuck up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>hotly</i>]. No.... Go over on
your own side. I don't want you here....
I want to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Helms....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Get out of here, I say....
And take your flowers with you. I accept
no presents from the like of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> The flowers&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Yes, take them away. And
take [<i>chokes over the word</i>] take Knut's
picture, too, and the stockings his father
sent.... I guess they're yours by right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. I'll do nothing
of the kind. My name's not Carl
Helms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, take the flowers then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>takes the flowers</i>]. I can do
that, all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And see that you don't come
on my side again without asking permission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>walks a few paces; turns
around</i>]. Hadn't I better straighten up
a bit before your guests come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You leave my things alone ...
and mind your business.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Krakau goes with the flowers to his
own side.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You've got the best of everything
anyhow. The stove is on your side
and the morning sun. Wouldn't you like
to take my arm chair too, and my pictures?
Don't mind me, you know.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Krakau does not answer. There is
a pause. A clock outside strikes
five.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> The clock's striking five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Let it strike.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is another pause. A knock
on the door is heard. Neither answers
it. There is a louder knock.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> [<i>Impatiently.</i>] Why don't
you answer the door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I'm not in the humor for company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> But some one is knocking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> What's that to me? [<i>There
is a third knock.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Obstinate old fool. [<i>Loudly.</i>]
Come in.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Hansen and Johnston enter. Behind

Helms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Many happy returns.
[<i>They shake hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>entering with Bolling</i>]. I'll
have to put him in your arm chair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Right over there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> [<i>Helping Bolling to the chair.</i>]
Our heartiest congratulations, eh, Bolling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> Hey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>speaking close to his ear</i>]. I
say we congratulate Helms on his birthday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> No. It's nothing to boast
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer</span> [<i>entering</i>]. Congratulations!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Now we're all here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Make yourselves comfortable.
[<i>They all take seats.</i>]</p>

My dear Peter, one doesn't whistle at a

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen</span> [<i>mocking him</i>]. My dear
Henry, mind your own affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> You have the soul of a
greengrocer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> You have the manners of a
barber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Those boys are always
fighting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> But they can't live without
each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>to Hammer</i>]. Aren't you lonely
since Kruger died?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> It is lonesome sometimes,
but I have more room now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> My wrists are so full of
rheumatism I can hardly bend them any
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> There's something the matter
with all of us. How is your throat,
Helms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Pretty good. [<i>There is silence
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Fine weather to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Regular birthday weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> On my birthday it always
rains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen</span> [<i>points to the window</i>]. You
can see the sun from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> I read in the papers about
your son-in-law's appointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>shortly</i>]. Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Yes, we must congratulate
you over again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Helms is the luckiest man
in the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Has your grandson been
here yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Of course he's coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Of course he'll come on
your birthday. He's a fine young fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Yes, indeed, Helms, you
should be proud of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer</span> [<i>sees Knut's portrait</i>]. There
he is. [<i>All except Helms and Bolling
look at the picture.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Looks something like his
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Yes, it's a striking resemblance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> The nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> And the eyes&mdash;look at the
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> We are looking at his grandson's
picture, Bolling.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Bolling stares indifferently. Helms

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> He's a lucky man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston</span> [<i>with a sigh</i>]. Ah yes, when
you have your family&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>showing the stockings</i>]. Helms
got some wonderful birthday presents,
Bolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling</span> [<i>feeling them</i>]. Good wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. What is Krakau
doing over there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Yes, why don't you
stop skulking over there like a homeless
dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>to Hammer</i>]. They have quarreled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> I guess so. [<i>To Hansen.</i>]
Have they had a fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> That's right, be sociable,
Krakau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>irritably</i>]. Why don't you get
the wine, Krakau?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> How should I know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>interrupts</i>]. You know it is
in the closet. [<i>Krakau takes bottle and
glasses from the cupboard.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer</span> [<i>delighted</i>]. Did you say
wine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Wine! Did you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> You might think Helms was
a postal inspector himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> More than that! He's a
millionaire in disguise. Krakau can tell
you&mdash;he has stockings full of good red
gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Hadn't we better push the

your table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> There'd be more room with

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling</span> [<i>suddenly to Krakau</i>]. What's
that you are pouring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Sherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. I can't stand port
wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes, but this is sherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> Port wine is poison.</p>

talk, Bolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> He's spoiling the whole
party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>apologetically</i>]. Bolling's
tired of living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> You're joking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> No; really he is. He wants
to die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Nonsense! How can any
one <i>want</i> to die? It's against human nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>who has taken cigars from

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> The sun is as red as wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen</span> [<i>with a sigh</i>]. Autumn is
coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> We've had Autumn weather
for two weeks past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Unseasonable weather! I
hate it. [<i>During the entire scene he has
been ill at ease, casting frequent apprehensive
glances at Krakau, who avoids
his gaze.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It isn't like it used to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> No. When the calendar
said <i>Summer</i> we <i>had</i> Summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling</span> [<i>apropos of nothing</i>]. I am
ninety-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>explaining apologetically</i>]. He

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Yes, with the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> The hospital doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes; he's a sick man himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Then it's a good thing she's
a nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Every young woman ought to
be trained as a nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>to Bolling</i>]. The nurse in the
hospital is going to marry the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> I was married, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Fill the glasses, Krakau.
[<i>Krakau does.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> How is Larsen's brain fever
getting along?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> He must be worse. The
porter chased the organ grinder away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> I thought I heard the organ.
Is this Thursday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Thursday, September twentieth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>testily</i>]. Don't show off, Krakau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston</span> [<i>raises his glass</i>]. Here's
health. Splendid sherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>to Buffe</i>]. Why aren't you
drinking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Thanks. I never take more
than one glass. This sunshine warms
you as much as wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> I have the morning sun in
my window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> So have I. It wakes me up
every morning. It's supposed to be
healthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Krakau stole it from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> You know very well that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Yes you did. And the stove,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> The stove&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Isn't the morning sun on your
side?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And the stove, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Didn't you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Nothing of the kind. You
live on the east side, and the morning
sun is healthiest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> We can change, for my part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Do you hear that? Now he
wants to steal my view of the street, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> What do you old friends
want to quarrel for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> And on your birthday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Who is quarreling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> You may be well satisfied with
the afternoon sun, Helms. See how
beautifully it shines in the window.
Look at the sun, Bolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> I've seen it before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>explaining with pride</i>]. Bolling
used to be a carpenter, you know.
He traveled all over the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> I have seen everything.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a rap at the door. Silence.
Krakau opens it, Knut enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut</span> [<i>to Krakau</i>]. Hello, Grandpop!
[<i>To Helms, shaking his hand.</i>] Congratulations,
grandfather. [<i>To the others.</i>]
Hello, everybody.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The old men nod their heads, delighted.
Buffe whispers to Bolling.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It's Knut. The son of Helms'
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> I had a son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I'm glad you came my&mdash;my
son [<i>glares at Krakau defiantly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> I can only stay a minute.
Have you heard about father's appointment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> He's been bragging to us
about it, sonny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> And treated us to sherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> Port wine is poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> And cigars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> Not really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Why don't you hang up your
cap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> I must be off in a minute.
Back to school. I had only an hour's
leave, and it takes half an hour to ride
each way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> How old are you, my boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> Seventeen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It's sixty-one years since I
was that young. He's only seventeen,
Bolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> I was seventeen&mdash;once.
Now I'm ninety-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> I am seventy-three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> Let's add up the number of
years in this room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> There's too many. It can't
be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut</span> [<i>with a laugh</i>]. Let's try.
[<i>Rapidly</i>] Mr. Bolling is 92 and grandfather
is 80; that's 172.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> There's quick counting for
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> How old are you, Mr. Buffe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Seventy-eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> That's 250.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer</span> [<i>in wonderment</i>]. Two hundred
and fifty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> And you, grandpop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Seventy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> 320. And you, Mr. Hammer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Seventy-three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> 393.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Think of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> And Mr. Hansen?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>All the old people except Bolling
and Hansen, snigger. Hansen turns
away, offended.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> Don't you know how old you
are, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Of course, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> He's ashamed to tell you.
Ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> He's afraid. Ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Who's afraid? [<i>Reluctantly.</i>]
I'm only sixty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old People.</span> "Only a boy."
"Not dry behind the ears." "He'll
grow." "Poor child."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> That makes 453.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston</span> [<i>beats his chest</i>]. I am
seventy-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> That gives us 528 altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Five hundred and twenty-eight!
What a head the boy has on
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>to Bolling</i>]. All together we
are 528 years old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> What does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> We'd be older still if there
weren't a boy among us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Yes, Hansen spoils it by
being so young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> You'll have to hurry, Hansen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Yes, so you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Why don't you take something
to make you grow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Oh, let me alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> Well, I must be going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old People.</span> "What a pity."
"Can't you be late for once?" "The
teacher won't mind."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knut.</span> I really must. Good-by, grandfather....
Hope you live eighty years
more.... Good-by, grandpop.... Good-by,
everybody. Good luck! [<i>He exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> You can see him go from
here. [<i>Goes to the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Can you? [<i>Joins him.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>All go to the window except Bolling,

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Open it. [<i>He helps Johnston

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> There he goes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> He is waving to us. [<i>All

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> What a fine lad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Good-by. [<i>All shout good-by.

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>turning away from the window,
with a sigh</i>]. He's gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen</span> [<i>low</i>]. Yes, he's gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> It's nice to have young
people around once in a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe</span> [<i>nods sadly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> You have a fine young grandson, Helms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>with an uneasy glance at Krakau</i>].
Yes, I can't complain of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It's good to have a family that
look after you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> It's good to have a family
at all. Many people haven't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> No. They die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Close the window,
Krakau. There's a draught. [<i>Krakau
closes the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Yes, the sun is down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Isn't it time we were going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> These <i>young</i> people should
be early to bed. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It really is time to go. Thank
you, Helms. It was a nice party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Going already? [<i>Glances uneasily
at Krakau.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> It's near supper time, you
know. We are going, Bolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammer.</span> Then we'll go too.... We
enjoyed your party, Helms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> The pleasure was mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> Good night, Helms. Next
time it's my party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> October 23rd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hansen.</span> Good-by&mdash;and many thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Not at all, not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Are you ready, Bolling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> Hum! [<i>He rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffe.</span> Good-by, everybody. [<i>To Bolling.</i>]
Say good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolling.</span> Good-by.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Krakau holds open the door. The

<p class="salute">[<i>Helms bustles about uneasily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>on his own side</i>]. Well, it

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Yes, very well&mdash;very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Want me to help you

come on! Where are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>taking the other end hastily</i>].
Coming, coming!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The table moved, there is another

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Need any help?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You stand there doing nothing

<p class="salute">[<i>Krakau takes the glasses, puts them

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Where are you going with my

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>stops</i>]. I was going to wash
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Well, don't forget whom they
belong to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Don't worry. [<i>Puts the
glasses on the wash stand.</i>] Shall I light
the lamp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You can't see in the dark, can
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>lighting the hanging lamp</i>].
Knut behaved very nicely, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>moodily</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> He made everybody happy
with his high spirits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Not me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>hastily changing the subject</i>].
It's funny about old Bolling. How he's
changed in the last year! He never talks
any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> When you get to be ninety-two
and not a relation in the world&mdash;[<i>His
voice breaks in self-pity.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>finished with the lamp, makes
a little solicitous gesture behind his
friend's back, but immediately busies himself
with putting things to right</i>]. Where
do you want these things to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> On the chiffonier ... next to
the other.... Bolling is so old he feels
superfluous.... I am getting like that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. Where do these
stockings and things go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Next to the last drawer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I guess you are all fixed now....
There's nothing else? [<i>Turns from
the chiffonier, having closed the drawer,
and starts for his own side of the room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. It's a terrible
thing you've done to me, Krakau!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>in surprise</i>]. What now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>his voice trembling</i>]. You
have made my dead wife a strumpet and
my dead daughter a bastard. [<i>Krakau
bridles and turns to him with clenched
fists. Helms continues pitifully.</i>] And
you have robbed me in my old age of a
grandson ... all I have in the world.
[<i>Querulously musing.</i>] When men are
young they see red and kill for that sort
of thing ... yes ... they kill.... But
when you are old it's different.... I
can't even be very angry with you, Krakau....
Isn't it queer?... It's all so
far back ... in the past ... impersonal
... and blurred like a half-remembered
dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>with contrition</i>]. I shouldn't
have told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You shouldn't have told me....
No ... but you did ... and I
can't be angry with you.... I am an old
fool.... After all ... honor ...
fidelity ... marriage vows ... what do
they matter when there is nothing to do
but to sit and count the days until you
die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>chokingly</i>]. Helms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>with a flash of anger</i>]. But
Knut matters. He <i>is</i> my grandson ...
in spite of you.... You shan't take
him away from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I don't want to take him
away from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Your blood ... perhaps ...
but <i>my grandson</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. Of course, he is,
Helms. We can share him between us.
Don't you see? He need never know.
No one need know ... just you and I....
We can have him together ...
our own little secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>looks at him</i>]. Nobody else
will know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>solemnly</i>]. Not a soul. I
swear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Nobody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>a faint smile dispels his
frown</i>]. And when we talk about Knut
you won't say "So-o" any more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Never ... for hereafter he'll
be <i>our</i> Knut ... just as if you were his
father and I his mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>the idea pleases him, considers
it, then gives his assent like a child playing
a game</i>]. No, I'll be the mother.
And we can quarrel about him ... of
course, in a friendly way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Always friendly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And just think&mdash;we shall
have something to talk about all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Especially at night ...
after supper ... under the lamp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> And when we are in bed in
the dark and cannot sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Always about our Knut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Ha, ha.... Do you know,
Krakau, I think you should have told me
long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I was afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Afraid! Absurd. What was
there to be afraid about? You can see
for yourself that we are better friends
since you told me. [<i>Goes to the chiffonier
and gets the photograph.</i>] He does
look something like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>magnanimously</i>]. Oh, no!
He's your wife's son all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>with equal magnanimity</i>]. He
looks a good deal like you just the same....
Don't you want to borrow this for
a few days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Why, you only got it this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Never mind. Take it....
Saturday I'll get it back from you. Then
in a few days I'll lend it to you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Thanks. [<i>Takes the photograph</i>].
Can I borrow the paper, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Sure, take it with you....
And lend me your chess men, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>with animation</i>]. I'll get it
for you. [<i>Goes to his own chiffonier for
it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> We might as well move the
tables together. It's more comfortable
that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Certainly. [<i>Comes down
with the chessboard and helps move the
tables.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Now you take my arm chair
and read your paper. I'll play over here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> I wouldn't think of taking
your chair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> You do as you are told. [<i>Sits
on an ordinary chair.</i>] I can reach better
from one of these anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Oh, well. [<i>Sits in the arm
chair and unfolds the newspaper. There
is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Why don't you light your
pipe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Your throat&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> My throat is all right. Go on
and smoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>comfortably lights his pipe,
relaxes</i>]. Well, now we'll see how good
you are at working out problems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> I don't think I can do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>reading</i>]. Sure you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Look here. Would you check
with the bishop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>studies the board</i>]. No ...
that loses you the queen.... Hum ...
you've sort of mixed it up.... Back
with that rook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> How's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Brilliant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Knut is back at school by this
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> Yes, probably studying his
lessons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> He's a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> None better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Isn't it nice to talk about him
like this ... calm and friendly?...
You have no cause to be jealous any
more, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> And you needn't be stuck up
any more, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> No, ha, ha! There, I've muddled
it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> No, you haven't.... Just
move here ... and here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>suddenly takes out his purse</i>].
By the way, I owe you twenty-seven
pfennig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> There's no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Take it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> All right. [<i>He rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>at the chiffonier</i>]. We forgot
the flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms.</span> Oh, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau.</span> They smell so fragrant.
[<i>Puts them on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>takes a flower and puts it in
Krakau's buttonhole</i>]. You must wear
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>overcome</i>]. Thank you,
Helms, thank you. [<i>They bend over the
chessboard again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>rubs his hands with delight</i>].
Now white moves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Krakau</span> [<i>considering</i>]. White moves....
I should say ... there ... that
pawn ... I'd sacrifice it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helms</span> [<i>picks it up with playful tenderness</i>].
Poor little white pawn! [<i>Places it on the board.</i>]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A very small room in a tar-papered
shanty, reeking poverty. The
entrance is center-back,&mdash;a few boards
nailed together for a door. A similar
door, opening into the bedroom of the
shack, upstage right. Downstage left, a
broken window. Left center, a rusty
cooking stove. Above it, a series of
shelves holding a few dishes and cooking
utensils. Rough board table in the center
of the room. A kitchen chair at the right
of the table. A large wooden rocker
near the stove; rope and wire hold it together.
An arm-chair, below the bedroom
door is full of newspapers. Several
heterogeneous colored prints culled
from out-of-date newspapers and calendars
are tacked on the rain-stained walls.
When the entrance door is open we see a
cleared, sandy spot with a background of

of a spring day.</i></p>

<p><i>A man of forty enters, leaving the bedroom
door open behind him. His small
head and childish face, on a tall, thin, and
extremely erect body, resemble those of a
species of putty-like rubber doll whose
head may be reshaped by the hand. He
wears a winter cap, blue flannel shirt,
well-worn trousers with suspenders, and
sneakers that were once white. Outside
shirt sleeves are rolled to the elbow; undershirt
sleeves are not. His shoes make
no noise; nevertheless, he comes on tiptoe,
his eyes fixed on the shelves. For a
moment he stops and glances into the
room he has just quitted. Satisfied, he
squats before the shelves. He hesitates,
then quickly lifts from a lower shelf an
inverted cooking vessel, and grasps a
small tin box which was hidden under it.
He inspects the box, trying to decide
whether he can pry open its lock.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[<i>The voice of an old, infirm man in the
adjoining room</i>]: Seth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seth</span> [<i>alarmed; starts to return the

<p class="salute">[<i>Seth strolls to the stove, lifts the
top from the kettle, and looks inside.
He finds a tin cup and fills
it with water. Looking into the
kettle again, he sees there is little
water left. Why make a trip to
the pump necessary? Back into
the kettle goes some of the water.
Cup in hand, he moves toward the
bedroom. He reaches the door
when a sagging bellied man enters
from the yard. It is Lon, the
elder, shorter brother. His face
has become molded into an expressionless
stare, and his every
movement seems to be made with
an effort. An abused man, Lon,
the most ill-treated fellow in the
world. At least, so he is ever at
pains to have all understand. He
wears an old felt hat, cotton shirt,
badly patched trousers, suspenders
attached to the buttons of his
trousers with string, and shoes that
are almost soleless. His shirt,
stained with sweat, is opened at
the throat, revealing red flannel
underwear. When Seth sees Lon
he immediately closes the bedroom
door, silently turns the key in the
lock, and puts the key in his pocket.
For a moment the men stand looking
at each other, reminding one
of two roosters. Then Seth strolls
to the stove, pours the water into
the kettle, and planks himself down
in the rocker. Lon glances once
or twice at the bedroom door, but
moves not to it. He watches Seth
suspiciously. Finally he speaks.</i>]</p>

Seth looks at Lon, sees
what he wants, but does not offer
him tobacco. Lon puts his pipe

table, sits, and sighs. He crosses
his right foot so Seth sees what
was once the sole of his shoe.</i>]</p>

they were about to discover a

each as near to it as possible, his
arms tense, fingers itching, ready
to ward off a blow or seize the
treasure. From the box, Seth
takes an old tobacco-pouch, a jack-knife,
a bit of heavy cord, a couple
of letters. These are contemptuously
thrown on the table. The

<p>[<span class="smcap">Place:</span> <i>In the morgue of a foreign
city</i>.]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A small almost empty room
with the rear wall of glass. Before this
glass black curtains are drawn. An old
man ... Caren ... sits at a low table,
well forward, sorting and arranging papers,
writing from time to time. A lamp
upon the table, is so shaded as to concentrate
the light and throws Caren's wicked
face into sharp relief. The room conveys
a feeling of unfriendliness, coldness and
gloom. Caren is old, so old he is somewhat
decrepit ... hard, shrill and tottering.
His features are sharp, his fingers
are as talons. He seems almost as
a vulture ... perhaps for hovering too
long among the unbeloved dead.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>calling to some one behind the
black curtain</i>]. What was the number
of that last one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper</span> [<i>putting out his head</i>]. Thirteen.
[<i>He disappears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>writes and repeats</i>]. Thirteen....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices</span> [<i>are heard, rough and harsh,
from in back of the curtains</i>]. Shove
that stiff up! He's got more room than
what's coming to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>calling, without rising</i>]. Who
is it you're moving?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Thirteen. Any reason why he
should sprawl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Not a bit. Shove him along.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The curtains part. There is a swift
vision of brilliant light within, and
bodies laid out upon tables of ice.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>a man, scarcely more than a
boy, over-wrought and hysterical, with
his hands pressed close to his throbbing
temples, bursts out</i>]. Oh.... Oh! Let
me stay here just a moment away from
that horror.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>glancing up from his writing
and smiles</i>]. You're all the same the
first day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Oh.... Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> That last one got you ... eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. So young ... so
young!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Must have been a good looker.
Much as you can tell the way his face is
banged up. I'll bet his own mother
wouldn't know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>turning aside</i>]. Don't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>titters</i>]. He ... he ... he!
Number thirteen...! I hope he ain't
superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He has nothing more to fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>with dread</i>]. There's no tellin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He's dead.... [<i>Enviously.</i>] ... Dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>angry</i>]. Fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>watching through the glass at
the placid figure, enviously</i>]. Dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>exasperated</i>]. Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>suddenly has a hideous thought
and turns swiftly to Caren</i>]. You think
it was fair...? He went of his own
free will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Eh...? What put that into
your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> No clothes ... naked!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> A lot of them do that when
they take the plunge. It ain't so easy to
identify them. It saves a lot of bother,
too. We stick 'em on the slabs a while
and then....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]. Don't! It makes
me cold ... cold! [<i>Again he parts the
curtains and looks through the glass.</i>]
He's so calm ... so still. I wonder if
he suffered first! [<i>With a clutch of
hatred in his voice.</i>] I wonder if&mdash;he
starved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> That soft white kitten? Not
much. Did you get a squint at his hands?
He's never even tied his own tie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>laughs</i>]. And he's here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>looking at Kraig</i>]. This is a
funny job for a kid like you to pick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>turning away</i>]. I'm not as
young as I look. I've got three little
ones already. [<i>With deep anguish.</i>]
And another on the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> It's a queer hang out for a kid
like you, just the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>hysterically, almost beside himself</i>].
I tell you ... there's another on
the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> What do you mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Nothing! [<i>A pause, then bitterly.</i>]
Oh there's one joy down here.
You can burrow and hide like a rat from
it all. The damn carriages don't roll by
before your eyes. The women don't!...
Oh, those women, how I hate them.
Their silks, their jewels, their soft white
skins. Fed! Clothed! Housed!...
[<i>Clenching his fists.</i>] While Martha
starves! Oh, God! They drive by
laughing and I could choke them! Listen
what happened. [<i>He comes closer to
Caren and speaks fanatically.</i>] Yesterday
in the park I stood there ... shivering
... wondering! And all at once
the mad hate came into my heart and I
felt that I could kill. [<i>Caren looks
alarmed.</i>] And then.... Ha ... ha
... ha! Then.... The King....
The King drove by. [<i>Laughing bitterly,
and with a great flourish.</i>] And off came
my hat! [<i>Making fun of himself.</i>] My
hat came off my head, Old Man, and I
bowed and cringed [<i>vehemently</i>] <span class="smcap">with
the hate in my heart</span>.  I could have
torn the warm furs from his throat and
wrapped my fingers in their place [<i>his
hands clench spasmodically</i>]. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>thoroughly alarmed</i>]. Hush....
Hush! You mustn't talk so of our
King. A nice young boy he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Oh the hate ... the hate.
Perhaps it will leave me here in this hall
of the dead. [<i>Glancing about.</i>] It all
seems so level here. So level.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>with the first faint touch of
sympathy</i>]. You're right. Here's the
one spot on earth where you get fair
play. That's what I like. There ain't
no rich and there ain't no poor. And
there ain't no class nor nothing. Every
man gets a square deal here ... a square
deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Perhaps that's worth dying
for&mdash;a square deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Dying ... bah! Wait until
you've seen a few more of them slung on
the slabs. You'll lose your longing for
death. I'm an old man, but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> If only I can see more of it.
If only I can bear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> The pay's not bad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> It would be bad at any price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>shaking his finger childishly</i>].
Tut ... tut! We're fair here ... fair.
There ain't no flowers ... he ... he
... he ... and there ain't no song [<i>he
chuckles</i>], but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>with intense passion, pacing to
and fro, and never pausing, while he
speaks very rapidly</i>]. If only the living
could have what is spent on the dead.
All the waste ... the hateful waste.
Flowers wilting in dead hands. Stones
weighing down dead hearts. While living
bodies famish and living eyes burn
for the sight of beauty. Oh, I wonder
the dead don't scream out at our madness.
I wonder the graves don't burst
with the pain of it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Have they shut me up with a
maniac? Have you gone stark out of
your mind?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a loud knocking on the
door, to the right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>opens it a crack and peeps out
cautiously</i>]. What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Let me in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Get away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>piteously, clamoring</i>]. Let me
look once ... just once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>harshly</i>]. Got a pass?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> No ... no. Oh, let me in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>bangs the door shut</i>]. Get
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. Let me look once
... just once. [<i>Caren opens the door a
crack.</i>] Are there any ... women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Women? Of course, there's
women ... always women. What is it
you've craving? The sight of the beauties
or the smell of their stinking flesh?
Go on ... get out. This isn't a bawdy
house. [<i>He slams the door to and walks
away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> What is it he wants?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> A peep at the stiffs. Probably
looking for his girl. [<i>He passes
out of sight, behind the black curtain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Oh! [<i>Cautiously he peeps
after Caren, then opens the door a crack
and calls in a whisper</i>]. Man!... You
can see the new ones through the panel
there. Lift up the curtain. There's two.
A blond haired girl and a boy. [<i>He
turns swiftly as the curtains part and
Caren re&euml;nters. Softly he shuts the door,
then stands watching into the hallway
through a glass partition.</i>] Poor soul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>mumbles as he returns</i>].
There's something queer about that last
young stiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Number thirteen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Yes, number thirteen. You
may have been right after all. Perhaps
it wasn't fair play to put him in the
river. There's some mystery ... something
wrong. [<i>Tittering.</i>] He ... he
... he! Not number thirteen for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>watching outside</i>]. How do
you know there's anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> That's telling, Sonny. [<i>With
deep meaning.</i>] But you get wise quick
... looking at the dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> People are telephoning and
messengers are on the way. Pah ...
things like this are a nuisance. They
keep one late. What are you watching?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> That man who was here at the
door. He doesn't go away. I wonder
what keeps him here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Conscience! Scared to death
he'll find his girl. Afraid not to look for
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> You mean?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Oh, there's just two things
drives people into the water. The men ... 'cause
they've got too little inside
'em.... The women....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>furious</i>]. Stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>alarmed, yet brazen ...
scratching his head</i>]. He ... he ...
he! Pretty clever little joke. He ...
he!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Kraig begins to pace the room, his
hands pressed to his temples.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> I must tell that to the boys
inside. [<i>He starts to go.</i>] Pretty clever
little joke!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>watching, excitedly</i>]. There's
something wrong with the fellow. I'd
better see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>pausing</i>]. You'd better shut
your eyes and see nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He is staggering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Let him stagger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He may be ill. He may be&mdash;starving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> He's come to a good place to
lose his appetite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Oh, let me see what's wrong
with him ... please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> You go out that door and
you don't come back. [<i>A pause.</i>] I
guess you'll stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>looks his hatred</i>]. Just as you
say.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Outside the door there is a short,
sharp scream.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Maria!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He's fallen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> He'll get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> I wonder what happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Perhaps he got a peep at the
new blonde. [<i>There is now a violent
banging on the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> He's here.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Caren opens the door cautiously a

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>crushed and broken</i>]. Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Shut up! Bottle the tears
until you get home. The first door to the
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> [<i>pleading</i>]. Cover her. For
the love of the Lord ... cover her.
Don't let her lie like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Ain't she covered enough to
suit you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Cover her ... cover her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Afraid she'll catch cold? Go
on ... get out! [<i>He slams the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>walks to the black curtains and
parts them slightly</i>]. His woman ...
his <small>LOVE</small>. [<i>Sighing and glancing towards
the door</i>.] Poor devil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> What's the matter with you,
Softy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Nothing. I was just thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Don't be a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>again walking back and looking
at the woman</i>]. Couldn't we cover her
just a little? The sheet seems to have
slipped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> And no harm done. Meat's
meat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>dreamily</i>]. Her hair would
cover her like a mantle. How soft
and white she is. And how happy she
seems. I wonder just when that look
came into her face. It surely wasn't there
when she plunged into the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. You ought to be
nurse maid to a doll baby. What are you
anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. A dreamer ...
a creator ... a starver!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Well, you're the wrong sort for
in here. This is one place where you get
down to facts; truth. No lies, no frills,
no dreams. Dreams don't count [<i>banging
his fist for emphasis</i>]. Money don't
count. Power don't count ... beauty
don't count. Nothing counts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>hotly</i>]. Then it's not truth if
beauty and dreams don't count. That's
what we starved for, Martha and I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>softening a little</i>]. Well, you
won't starve here. It's a fair place ...
fair. The King himself wouldn't be
treated no different than a beggar. The
man with brains and the man without....
[<i>The curtains part and a helper
enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> Some one wants to blink at
number thirteen. He's got two swell
dames with him. Can they go in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> If their permit's all right.
Yes. Bring them in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> They won't come in here.
They want to go in the private way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> I know there's some mystery
about number thirteen....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> Yes, there is. He's a swell
... a big one. I shouldn't wonder if....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Go on. Get out. [<i>The helper
goes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Aren't you going to cover the
boy before you let them enter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> If they can't see him how are
they going to know him? He ain't a
tailor's dummy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> It all seems horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> I guess you'll never see a
second day at this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> Oh.... Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> You think I'm going to tuck
on a few extras just because he's a swell.
[<i>Yelling.</i>] Don't I keep telling you 'til
there's not a breath left in my body, that
there ain't no class here? [<i>The helper
re&euml;nters and hears the last words. He
stands breathless.</i>] Tramp or gentleman,
they're all alike. Now get that into your
head and let it grow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper</span> [<i>has been stammering trying to
speak</i>]. I oughtn't to tell. They'd kill
me if they knew. It's to be kept a secret,
but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> Number thirteen.... [<i>Stammering.</i>]
He ... he....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Well, what about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> He ain't a loafer. He ain't
a tramp. He ain't even a gentleman.
He....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Who is he? Quick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper.</span> Our.... [<i>Exultantly.</i>] Our
King!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>open-mouthed, aghast</i>]. Our
... King!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>laughing triumphantly</i>]. Ha
... ha ... ha ... ha&mdash;<small>HERE</small>! [<i>He
clasps his hands together.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>excited</i>]. Are you mad, Boy,
mad? Our King! Oh!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Kraig laughs. Both men stare at
him horrified.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helper</span> [<i>to Caren</i>]. Ain't you got a
flag or something ... some little mark
of respect to cover his nibs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>to Kraig</i>]. Run upstairs and
get that big silk flag that.... [<i>as Kraig
does not move</i>]. Go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>immovable, abruptly ceasing to
laugh</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren</span> [<i>threateningly</i>]. What do you
mean? No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig</span> [<i>hysterically</i>]. This is one place
in the world where all are treated fair.
Dreams don't count. <span class="smcap">Power</span> don't count.
There's no rich, no poor....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caren.</span> Shut up and get that flag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kraig.</span> You're going to cover him
... but she.... Oh! [<i>Both men disappear
behind the curtains, cringing and
bowing to people within. Caren, with
his back to the curtains, does not realize
that he is alone.</i>] Even death can't level.
No ... not even death. [<i>For a second
he stares ahead of him piercingly into
space, standing taut and rigid. Then
commences to laugh in pure hysteria as</i></p>

<h2>A DEATH IN FEVER FLAT</h2>

<p class="alignleft">A Play</p>
<p class="alignright">By George W. Cronyn</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">The Scene</span> <i>is laid in the so-called
dining-room of one of those forlorn hostelries
of the great Plains, which goes by
the name of Mace's Good Hope Roadhouse,
a derisive title evidently intended
to signify the traveler's hope of early
escape from its desiccated hospitality.</i></p>

<p><i>This room is sometimes reluctantly
frequented by a rare guest, usually a
passenger on his way via auto stage, to
some place else, whom delays en route
have reduced to this last extremity of
lodging for the night. The room is a
kind of lumber yard of disused cheap
hotel furniture.</i></p>

<p><i>Nothing can be drearier.</i></p>

<p><i>Most of this junk is heaped along the
left (stage) wall, and it has a settled look
of confusion which the processes of gradual
decay will, apparently, never disturb.
Tables tip crazily against the plaster of
the greasy wall. Chairs upturned on
these, project thin legs, like the bones of
desert places, toward a ceiling fantastically
stained. One table smaller than
the rest, sees occasional use, for it stands
somewhat out of the d&eacute;bris and has about
it three chairs reasonably intact. A pack
of cards and several dirty glasses adorn
the top.</i></p>

<p><i>A stairway rises along the right wall,
beginning at the rear, and attaining to a
rickety landing, supported by a single
post of doubtful strength, to which is
affixed a glass lamp in a bracket. (Inasmuch
as the stairway is turned away from
the audience, those who ascend are completely
hidden until their heads top the
last riser.) At the right front, between
the landing and the proscenium, a door
(now shut) leads to the Bar, the one spot
of brightness in this lump, the shining
crack at its sill bespeaking the good cheer
beyond. And that crack is the only illumination
to this morgue of defunct appetites,
for the moonlight, which enters
by way of a small window at the right,
is rather an obscuration, inasmuch as it
heightens the barren mystery of the
room's entombing shadows.</i></p>

<p><i>Double doors center of rear wall lead
to the outside. A window on either side
of the door.</i></p>

<p><i>So much for the melancholy set.</i></p>

<p><i>From the Bar percolates the lubricated
melodiousness of the few regular customers
who constitute the population of
Fever Flat, with the exception of three
worn-out women folks, two haggard
cows and three hundred or so variegated
dogs. The female element are to home,
the dogs, astray and astir, with lamentable
choruses.</i></p>

<p><i>Sounds from the Bar, samples only.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Jolly Soul</span> [<i>hoarsely</i>]. Pitch into
her, boys! Tune up your gullets! [<i>With
quavering pathos.</i>] "She was born in old
Kentucky"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Such</span> [<i>with peeve</i>]. Aw, shet
up, that's moldy! Giv's that Tennessee
warble, Hank!</p>

"When your heart was mine, true love,<br />
And your head lay on my breast,<br />

bright shaft is visible through the
rear windows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voices.</span> Stage's come! Stage's come!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There are sounds indicating the
rapid evacuation of the Bar, and a
moment later one of the rear doors
is jerked open and the Stage Driver
enters, dragging in two heavy suitcases
which he deposits near the
small  table  with  appropriate
grunts, meanwhile encouraging the
passengers to enter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stage Driver.</span> Uh! perty lumpy bags&mdash;come
in, folks, come in! Seems like
you might be carryin' all your b'longings.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The two passengers enter; the man,
quickly, nervously, almost furtively;
the woman, with that weariness
which ignores everything except
its own condition.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stage Driver.</span> Come in and set, lady;
don't be skeered. Looks a little spooky,
but Hank'll have a glim fer ye in two
shakes. [<i>Places a chair for her.</i>] Here,
I know you're plumb tuckered. Make
y'self t'home. [<i>Looking around at the
drear surroundings.</i>] 'S fer 's yer able.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man.</span> I thought the stage went
through to Hollow Eye to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Driver.</span> Well, sir, she do, but this time
she don't. I've been havin' to run ten
miles on low already and I jest don't <i>dast</i>
take her across that thirty miles of sand
the way she is. She'll drink water like
a thusty hoss and like as not lay down
and die on us half way out. Then
where'd we be? No sir; you folks'll just
have to camp here at Fever Flat till I
kin do a tinkerin' job to-morrow mornin'.
So I'll step into the Bar and tell Hank
you're here. [<i>At the door to the Bar.</i>]
Hank'll do the best he kin fer ye. He's a
squ'ar man. Good-night to ye! [<i>Goes
out, leaving the door half open.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man</span> [<i>briefly</i>]. Good-night. [<i>Looking
about.</i>] What a hole! Like somebody
died here and they'd gone off and
left it all stand just the way it was.
[<i>He goes to the open door at the rear and
stares at the naked moonlit buttes.</i>] Them
hills gits my goat. They're nothin' but
blitherin skeletons, and this bunch of
shacks they call Fever Flat looks like no
more'n a damn bone yard to me. [<i>Shutting
the door.</i>] Ugh! it's cold in here.
Feel like I was sittin' on my own grave's
edge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> [<i>scarcely raising her head,
and speaking with no emotion, in a dead
dry voice.</i>] You didn't use to be so pernickety,
when you was punchin' on the
range, Lon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>waspishly</i>]. And you didn't use
to look like a hag, neither, Padie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>with a momentary flash</i>].
Drink's poisoning your tongue, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>viciously</i>]. Who's drinking?
Cain't I take a thimbleful now'n then
without all this jawin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie.</span> You ain't takin' thimblefuls.
You're just soakin' it up. You'll be gettin'
snakes if you keep on. 'n then,
what'll <i>I</i> do? [<i>Resuming her air of
weary indifference.</i>] Not that I care so
much what you do with yourself&mdash;or
what becomes of me. Nothing matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>petulent and aggrieved</i>]. There
you go, actin' abused. How 'bout <i>my</i>
rights 'n pleasures? Ain't got none, I
s'pose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie.</span> Oh, shut up, you make me sick.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Hank enters; a ruddy, vigorous,
young man, strangely out of place
among all this rubbish. He wears
a barkeeper's apron and speaks
cordially.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Howdyedo, folks! Howdye
do! Well, this is a kinda rough lay-out
fer you-all. Y'see the Stage is due here
at five, and stops fer grub, then makes
Hollow Eye by about nine, but here 'tis
... [<i>pulls out watch</i>] half an hour of
midnight an' I s'pose you ain't et, yet, eh?
[<i>Lights the glass lamp.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie.</span> Thanks. We've had sandwiches,
but maybe my husband'd like something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>significantly</i>]. Wet.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Padie shrugs indifferently, and fixes
her hair. As she turns toward
Hank, the light for the first time
falls full on his face. Padie stares
fixedly at him, and half rises, with
a little cry.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>with a quick, startled glance at
Hank, speaks to her in a sharp, threatening
voice</i>]. Padie! Sit down! Are you
gittin' plumb loco drivin' out so late in
autymobiles? [<i>To Hank, apologetically.</i>]
You kinda flustered us, mister, cause you
have a little the look a friend of ourn
that died suddint. Mournful case.
Pardner o'mine. No, you're not much
like. He was tall, heavy-built and lighter
complected. Must a been consid'ble
older, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>almost in a whisper</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Older, I say. My wife's kinda
wrought up by this here little spell of
travelin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> [<i>sympathetically</i>]. Oh, you're
not used to it, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>slowly and deliberately</i>]. We've
been at it&mdash;[<i>draws out the word into a
burden</i>] years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. That is, off'n on,
m'dear. Only off'n on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>monotonously</i>]. All the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> [<i>trying to be a little jocose
to break the oppressive atmosphere</i>].
Should think you might hanker after yer
own nest, lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>rising rudely</i>]. Well, just keep
your thoughts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span>  [<i>completely abashed</i>]. Yes,
ma'am. Your room is just at the top of
the landin'. I'll make ye a light. [<i>He
hustles away upstairs to cover his embarrassment,
taking the suitcases with him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>irritably</i>]. You're always tryin'
to belittle me in public. Is that any way
fer a wife to act? I wanta know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie.</span> What do you always lie so
fer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>with rising voice</i>]. That's my
business. I'll do as I damn please. And
don't you go too fer, crossin' me. I won't
stand it. Some day I'll up, an&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span>  [<i>contemptuously</i>]. Beat me.
That's all that's left to <i>you</i>, wife-beater.</p>

strike her, but lets it fall as Hank
reappears on the landing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Excuse me, m'am. Have you
your own towels by you? Ourn is pretty
scaly. It's been so long since we've had
in women folks, at least, ladies.</p>

Thanks, we have some.</p>

audience, descends.</i>]</p>

Padie. You ain't got none other but me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Padie</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. Yes, you've took me
from 'em. We've been trapsin and trapsin
till I'm plumb sick. Yes, I'm&mdash;</p>

blindly toward the stair, almost
into the arms of Hank, which further
increases his consternation.</i>]</p>

There's the ladder, m'am. Can't I fetch
you somethin'? Toddy?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Padie shakes her head, runs up, and
slams her door.</i>]</p>

Women folks is cur'us, cur'us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>surlily</i>]. Take my advice and
keep free from 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> It was a woman did fer my
brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>with increased interest</i>]. Oh,
you've got a brother, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> [<i>simply</i>]. Had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Down at Laguna Madre, Arizony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>leaning forward and gripping the
edge of the table</i>]. Ranchin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Buried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>haltingly</i>]. How&mdash;what were
you saying&mdash;about a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> A woman done fer him. That's
what they said, I don't know. I didn't
git there fer a long time. There was a
mix-up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Well, well. That's strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. I s'pose you heard
of it? It was in all the papers. It even
got as fer as Denver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> No, I don't remember. But I've
read of similar cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> You've been to Arizony, I
s'pose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> No, not quite. I've been all
around them parts, but never Arizony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> 'Tain't what you'd call a perty
country, but it's mighty satisfyin'. Too
blame cold up here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Why don't you move?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> I'm agoin' to, but you see my
brother had half interest in this here tavern
and there was some litigation about
it. Case's just finished. I been here
three years, ever since he went. But I'm
pullin' my stakes, you bet. I wouldn't
be <i>buried</i> here!  Would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>dryly</i>]. I'd rather not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> So she took me fer a friend
that'd croaked, eh? That's cur'us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Eh? What's that? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Your wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Oh, yes. Well, he was a good
ten years older. And dark-complected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Thought you said he was light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> Mebbe I did. Well, he mought

size him up by the average, he was dark.
Let's fergit him. Bring us a bottle of
your best&mdash;and see that the glass is
clean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> To be sure. [<i>Goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lon sits with his head between his

rear opens soundlessly, revealing
the vast expanse of moonlit plains
and desolate buttes. Lon shivers
and turns up his coat collar, finally
facing about to discover the cause
of the chill. Observing the open
door, he goes to it, closes and locks
it, the click of the key being distinctly
audible. He then returns
and sits as before, and again the
song comes.</i>]</p>

right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Now it's blame cur'us the way
old places gits. You'll hear these floor
boards creak at times like as if som'un
was sneakin' over 'em b'ar-foot. Feller
told me onct it was made by contrapshun
and temper'ture. Mebbe so, but I reckon
[<i>knowingly</i>] there's more goes on around
than we give credit fer.</p>

'em that. But it's a fact, there's more

flicker and wane. Lon holds the
paper closer to his face, finally almost
buries his nose in it, as if
conscious of the Presence, but stubbornly
resolved to ignore it. The
Figure moves, and as it crosses the
threshold the feeble light expires.

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>stubbornly</i>]. Believe? Well! I

with the booze. I knowed it'd be the
snakes or you. Padie told me I'd be
seein' things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>maliciously</i>]. So you believe
in <i>her</i>, anyway. Well, how's Padie&mdash;and
the children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> You know damn well we ain't
had none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> What, no children! How unfortunate!
The house of love not to be
graced with fruit ... sterile, sterile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>belligerently</i>]. Er you referrin'
to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> To your spiritual union only,
my friend. Physically, I know, nothing
was wanting for a perfect match,&mdash;female
form divine to mate with big blond
beast. A race of superpeople!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> What the hell 'r' you gabbin'?
You allus had a lot of talky-talk. That's
what made a hit with Padie, before, before&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Before the Other Man came
along and cut us both out. [<i>Sings.</i>]</p>

<p>
And many a girl that stays at home alone<br />
And rocks the cradle and spins.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>reflectively</i>]. Yes, I'm afraid
we both stood up pretty poorly alongside
him. I had the words, the brain, the
idea. I could charm her, tantalize her,
quicken her mind, arouse her imagination.
That's why I cut you out with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>sneeringly</i>]. Gab!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Yes, gab. It was one better
to her than mere brute&mdash;guts! You personified
strength. You didn't have nerves
enough to be afraid of anything. You
had endurance, cheek, deviltry, and a
kind of raw good nature. These took
with the gay, immature girl she was,
until I came. You had&mdash;Guts; I had&mdash;Gab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> And the Other Feller?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> He had the Gift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon.</span> What you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> He was a full man. His personality
exuded from him like incense.
It wrapped and enfolded you and warmed
you, and yet it was not a grain feminine,
but deeply, proudly masculine. You tolerated
him, I&mdash;loved him. I had the fine
passion for Padie, but when I first saw
the two of them together I <i>knew</i> she was
his, or [<i>with a keen, stern look at Lon</i>]
<i>ought</i> to be ... and she <i>has</i> been, always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>jumping to his feet, and knocking
over his chair</i>]. You lie like hell!
She's mine! She's been mine all these
three years! I won her and I own her!
What little of love she ever had fer you
or him is buried down in Laguna Madre
with the bones of both of ye! And all
hell can't take her from me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>rising tall and pale</i>]. <i>He</i> kin,
and he's done it! You <i>thought</i> you'd got
her. But he's had her, or rather, she's
had <i>him</i> in her heart ever since they
took the rope from his neck and pronounced
him legally dead, and justice
vindicated, and laid him away in the
desert. All that time since, he's belonged
to her. When you laid by her side nights,
it was <i>his</i> arm she felt about her waist,
not yours; his breath was on her cheek,
and his heart was beating against hers.
Oh you poor, poor fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lon</span> [<i>throwing his glass straight at the
ghost</i>]. You lyin' pup!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>bursting into a gale of eerie
laughter</i>]. Ha! ha! ha! you <i>poor</i> fool!
<i>Now</i> you believe in me!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lon whips out his revolver and
aims at the ghost, then slowly returns
it to the holster, as he realizes
the futility of the move.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Go on, my boy! Let's have
another one here. [<i>He points to the
dark hole in his forehead.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lon, wiping his own face with the
back of his hand, and shuddering,
slumps down into his seat and
stares vacantly at the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Another one, just like the last&mdash;for
your friend and pardner. [<i>He
stresses the words with intense irony.</i>]
Do you remember the <i>last</i> time you pulled
that trick? What a foxy one it was!
How astutely planned! <i>Planned</i>, my
friend. I remember when we two went
up the canyon together, just such a shining
night as this, I asked you why you
had borrowed&mdash;the Other Man's horse,
and you said, yours was a little lame.
Oh! excellent dissembler! Most crafty
of liars! You <i>stole</i> that horse. You
stole that horse to put a rope around the
Other Man's neck! You knew the pinto
was shod different from any pony in
those parts. You knew where they'd
track him to, when they found the job
you'd done. Then we sat down to smokes
and cards. And I remember the curious
glitter in your eyes. I was dealing.
[<i>The Ghost shuffles the cards on the table,
then lays down the pack in front of
Lon.</i>] Cut!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lon mechanically obeys.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>dealing</i>]. And after several
hands, you brought up the subject of
Padie. And I told you I was out of
the race&mdash;and that you'd better get out
too, because the best man already had
her. And then&mdash;and then I sensed you
were going to draw, and when I had my
gun out, it was empty. Clever boy!
You had it fixed right. And so you
plugged me square. And the moon and
stars went out for me and I dropped into
the black gulf.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lon, throwing his hand down, buries
his face in his hands, groaning.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>pitilessly</i>]. You left me with
my face to the stars for the coyotes to
find. Then, very coolly, you turned the
Other Man's horse toward home and sent
him off cracking. And you jumped to
a pi&ntilde;on log that led off to a ledge of lava
where your footprints wouldn't show.
And you turned up in half an hour with
the boys in town. Then you inquired casually
where the Other Man was. You
<i>knew</i>, you devil! You knew they'd never
get an alibi from him for that night,
'cause&mdash;Padie was with him. Padie had
her dear arms about his neck while you,
clever dog! were out fixing to put a rope
there. And you done it, too! <i>Won</i> her?
Yes, you did&mdash;like hell! After the trial
was all over, and the dead buried, me
and him, you passed a dirty whisper
around town about her, and then married
her, to save her good name. That's how
you won her.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is an immense silence, broken
only by the heavy breathing of
Lon, which comes in rattling
gasps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost</span> [<i>sings</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> But I ain't forgot all you done

<p><span class="smcap">Second Girl.</span> Ah! he is coming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Girl.</span> No. It is only the little

<p><span class="smcap">First Girl.</span> Some day they will go.

<p><span class="smcap">Second Girl.</span> What is the secret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Girl.</span> That he is a slave. He
pretends! He pretends! But always he
knows in his heart that he is a slave.
Only of those who have learned his secret
is he afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Girl.</span> Tell me more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Girl.</span> Over those who are afraid

<p><span class="smcap">Second Girl.</span> How did he know? Because
he was one of those who are kings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Girl.</span> No. Because he was one
of those who are afraid.</p>

that Life is very beautiful. Is he so? I

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A dingy room showing the very
worst of contemporary lower middle-class
American taste. The dining table in the
center is of "golden oak"; and a sideboard
at the left, a morris chair at the
right and front, and three dining-room
chairs (one of which is in the left rear
corner, the others at the table) are all of
this same finish. The paper on the walls
is at once tawdry and faded. A tarnished
imitation brass gas jet is suspended from
the right wall, just over the morris chair.
In the back wall and to the left is a door
leading outside. Another door, in the
left wall, leads to the rest of the house.
A low, rather dirty window in the back
wall, to the right of the center, looks out
on a muddy river with the dispiriting
houses of a small, grimy manufacturing
city beyond. On the back wall are one
or two old-fashioned engravings with sentimental
subjects, and several highly-colored
photographs of moving picture
stars, each of them somewhat askew. A
few pictures on the other walls are mostly
cheap prints cut out of the rotogravure
section of the Sunday paper. In the
right-hand rear corner is an air-tight
stove. The whole room has an appearance
of hopeless untidiness and slovenliness.
Close by the morris chair, at its
right, is a phonograph on a stand. Outside
it is a dull gray day. The afternoon
light is already beginning to wane.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, James Madden is
sitting behind the table in the center of
the room. He is a rather small man of
thirty-five, his hair just beginning to turn
gray at the temples. Spectacles, a peering
manner, and the sallow pallor of his
face all suggest the man of a sedentary
mode of life. His clothes are faded and
of a poor cut, but brushed and neat.
There is something ineffectual but distinctly
appealing about the little man.
Madden is working on a pile of bills
which are strewn over the top of the
table. He picks up a bill, looks at it,
and draws in his under lip with an expression
of dismay. He writes down the
amount of the bill on a piece of paper,
below six or seven other rows of figures.
He looks at another bill, and his expression
becomes even more distracted.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>with exasperation</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He brings his fist down on the table
with a limp whack, then turns and
looks helplessly toward the door at
the left. After a moment this door
starts to open. Madden turns
quickly to the front, trying to compose
his face and busying himself
with the bills. The door continues
to open, and Mrs. Madden now issues
from it lazily. She is thirty-two
years old, and a good half head
taller than her husband. Where
he is thin and bony, she has already
begun to lose her figure. Her yellow
hair, the color of molasses
kisses, is at once greasy and untidy,
and seems ready to come to
pieces. Her face is beginning to
lose its contour&mdash;the uninspired
face of a lower middle-class woman
who has once been pretty in a
rather cheap way. She is sloppily
dressed in showy purple silk. Her
skirt is short, and she wears brand
new, high, shiny, mahogany-colored
boots. She has powdered her
nose.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>uninterestedly, in a
slow, flat, nasal voice</i>]. How long y'
been home? Yer pretty late f'r Sat'rdy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>still looking down and trying
to control his feelings</i>]. The head bookkeeper
kept me, checkin' up the mill pay
roll. I been here [<i>consulting his watch</i>]
just seven minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>yawning</i>]. Thanks.
Yer s' darn acc'rate, Jim. I didn' really
wanta know.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He looks at another bill and writes
down the amount on the same piece
of paper as before, keeping his
head averted so that she may not
see his face.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Jim. [<i>With lazy self-satisfaction.</i>]
Look up an' glimpse yer
wifey in 'r new boots. [<i>She draws up
her skirts sufficiently to show the boots.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He looks up unwillingly and makes
a movement of exasperation.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Oh, Florrie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> W'at's a matter?
Don'choo like 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> You didn't need another
pair, Florrie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>on the defensive</i>]. Y'
wouldn' have me look worse 'n one o'
these furriners, would y'? There's Mrs.
Montanio nex' door; she's jus' got a pair
o' mahogany ones an' a pair o' lemon
colored ones. An' <i>her</i> husban's on'y a
"slasher."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Slashers get a big sight more
pay than under bookkeepers these days,
Florrie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>persuasively</i>]. Got 'em
at a bargain, anyways. Jus' think, Jim.
On'y twelve, an' they <i>was</i> sixteen.
[<i>Madden groans audibly. She changes
the subject hastily.</i>] W'at's a news down
town?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>seriously</i>]. Florrie&mdash;
[<i>He hesitates and then seems to change his
mind. He relaxes and speaks wearily,
trying to affect an off-hand manner.</i>]
Nothin' much. [<i>Struck by an unpleasant
recollection.</i>] Comin' home by Market
Wharf I saw 'em pull a woman out o'
the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>interested</i>]. Y' don'
say, Jim. Was she dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. I ... I don't
know. I didn't stop. [<i>He passes his
hand across his face with a sudden gesture
of horror.</i>] You know, Florrie, I
hate things like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Well&mdash;y' poor boob!
Not t' find out if she was dead!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She gives an impatient shrug of the
shoulders and passes behind him,
going over to the back window and
looking out aimlessly. Madden
picks up another bill, regarding
it malevolently. After a moment
she turns carelessly toward him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Jim. [<i>He does not
look up.</i>] Say, Jim. I'm awful tired o'
cookin'. There ain't a thing t' eat in th'
house. Le's go down t' Horseman's f'r
a lobster supper t'night, an' then take
in a real show. Mrs. Montanio's tol'
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>interrupting very gravely</i>].
Florrie. [<i>He rises to his feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>continuing without a
pause</i>]. There's an awful comical show
down t' th' Hyperion. Regal'r scream,
they say. Mrs. Montanio&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>breaking in</i>]. Florrie, there's
somethin' I got to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>a little sulky</i>]. I got
lots I'd like t' say t' <i>you</i>. On'y I ain't
sayin' it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>more quietly</i>]. I wasn't goin'
to say it now ... not 'till I finished
goin' through these. [<i>He makes a gesture
toward the bills.</i>] But when I saw
your new shoes, an' specially when you
spoke o' goin' out to-night....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Well, why shouldn' I?
I got t' have <i>some</i> fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>keeping his self-control</i>].
Look here, Florrie. D'you know what I
was doin' when you came in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> I didn't notice. Figgerin'
somethin', I s'pose. Y' always are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> This mornin' at the office I
got called to the phone. The Excelsior
Shoe Comp'ny said you cashed a check
there yesterday for fifteen dollars. Said
you bought a pair o' shoes ... those, I
suppose [<i>He looks at her feet. She turns
away sulkily.</i>] ... an' had some money
left over. Check came back to 'em this
mornin' from the bank.&mdash;"No funds."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>with righteous but lazy
indignation</i>]. How'd I know there wasn't
no money in th' bank?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> If you kept your check book
up to date you'd know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> W'at right they got not
t' cash my check?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>still controlling himself</i>].
The bank don't let you overdraw any
more. [<i>He glances back at the bills.</i>]
D'you know, I'm wonderin' why you
didn't charge those boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> I ain't got any account
at th' Excelsior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> I guess it's the only place in
town you haven't got one.&mdash;You don't
seem to remember what salary I get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Sure&mdash;I know. Ninety-five
a month. Y' know mighty well I'm
ashamed o' you f'r not gettin' more.
Mrs. Montanio's husban'&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>breaking in</i>]. Hang the Montanios!
[<i>More quietly.</i>] Don't you see
what I'm gettin' at? Here it is the
twelfth o' December; you know my pay
don't come in till the end o' the month;
an' here you go an' draw all our money
out o' the bank ... an' more. [<i>Turning
toward the table.</i>] An' <i>look</i> at these
bills!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> James Madden, I like
t' know w'at right you got t' talk t' me
like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>thoughtfully</i>]. I've always
argued it's the woman's job to run the
house. [<i>He walks around the table from
front to rear, passing to its left, and
looking down at the bills. With conviction.</i>]
It's no use!&mdash;I don't just see
how we're goin' to get out of this mess;
but I do know one thing. [<i>Advancing
toward her from the rear of the table.</i>]
After this <i>I'm</i> goin' to spend our money,
even if I have to buy your dresses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>with rising anger</i>]. If
you say I've been extrav'gant, James
Madden, yer a plain liar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>biting his lip and stepping
back a pace</i>]. Easy, Florrie!&mdash;I know
you don't mean that, or&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>interrupting viciously</i>].
I do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>persuasively</i>]. Look here,
Florrie. We got to work this out together.
There's no use gettin' mad.
Prob'ly you aren't extravagant&mdash;really.
Just considerin' the size o' my salary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span>. A pig couldn' live decent
on <i>your</i> salary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span>. Other folks seem to get on,
even in these times. What would you do
if we had kids?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span>. Thank the Lord we
ain't got <i>them</i> t' think about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. Florence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Well, I guess anybody'd
be glad not t' have kids with <i>you</i> f'r a
husban'. Y' don't earn enough money
t' keep a cat&mdash;let alone kids! An' jus'
t' think they'd be like you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>more surprised than angry</i>].
Florence&mdash;you're talking like a street
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Oh, I am, am I? Well,
I guess you treat me like a street woman.
Y' don' deserve t' have a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Well, I don't guess I do.
Not one like you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> That's right! That's
right! You don' know how t' treat a
lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>controlling himself</i>]. Look
here, Florrie. Don't let's get all het up
over this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Who's gettin' het up?
[<i>Bursting past him toward the door at
the left.</i>] I wish t' God you was a gen'leman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Florrie&mdash;<i>don't</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>turning on him from the
other side of the table</i>]. W'y don't y' go
out an' dig in th' ditch? Y'd earn a damn
sight more money th'n&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>with angry impatience</i>].
You <i>know</i> I'm not strong enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden.</span> Bony little shrimp!
Not even pep enough t' have kids!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>beside himself</i>]. Florence!
[<i>Going toward her.</i>] I'm goin' to tell
you some things I never thought I would.
You're just a plain, common, selfish, vulgar
woman! You don't care one penny
for anybody except yourself. You an'
your clothes an' your movies an' your
sodas an' your candy! [<i>Mrs. Madden is
glowering at him across the table. She
is beginning to weep with rage.&mdash;Two or
three times she opens her mouth as if to
speak, but each time he cuts her short.</i>]
Look at the way you been leavin' this
house lately. [<i>He makes an inclusive
gesture toward the room.</i>] The four
years I've lived with you would drive a
saint to Hell! [<i>Mrs. Madden marches
furiously by him and over to her hat and
coat, which are hanging from pegs at
the right, just in front of the stove.</i>] I
wish I'd never seen you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>getting her coat and
hat</i>]. D' y' think I'm goin' t' stay in this
house t' be talked to like that? [<i>Putting
on her hat viciously.</i>] D' y' think I'm
goin' t' stand that kind of a thing? [<i>Putting
on her coat.&mdash;Sobbing angrily.</i>] I
guess ... you'll be ... pretty sorry
when I've ... gone. [<i>Coming closer to
him on her way to the outside door.</i>] If
... if I <i>did</i> somethin' ... if somethin'
... <i>happened</i> t' me ... I guess you
... you wouldn't never ... f'give yerself!
[<i>She is at the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> I don't worry about you.
[<i>She turns on him at the door.</i>] You
wouldn't do anything like that. You're
too <i>yellow</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>at the door. Sobbing,
in a fury</i>]. You'll ... see!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>With one last glare at him, she
turns, opens the door and goes outside,
slamming the door behind her.
Madden stares after her, almost
beside himself. He takes several
steps across the room, then crosses
and recrosses it, trying to regain
control of himself. Little by little
his anger fades; the energy goes
out of his pacing, and finally he
approaches the table and sits down
in his old place with a hopeless
droop of the shoulders. He takes
up another bill and looks at its
amount helplessly, finally writing
it down on the same piece of paper
as before. He starts to add up the
total of the bills he has already set
down on the piece of paper. His
hand moves mechanically. Suddenly
a shadow crosses his face, as
an idea begins to form itself in his
mind. He looks straight ahead, his
eyes opening wide with horror.
With a sudden movement he springs
up from the table and goes quickly
to the window, where he looks out
anxiously at the river. He turns
back into the room, and passes his
hand across his face with the same
gesture of horror he used earlier
in speaking to Mrs. Madden of the
woman who had fallen into the
river.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Ugh!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He returns to the table, his face
dark with the fear that has seized
him. At the table, he stands a moment,
thinking. Once again he
passes his hand across his forehead
with the same gesture of horrified
fear. He drops into the chair behind
the table, still thoughtful.
After a moment his face clears,
and he shakes his head with an expression
of disbelief. He bends
again over the bills, and once more
takes up his work of going over
them. From outside comes the
faint sound of some one whistling
"Tell Me." Gradually the whistle
grows louder and louder, as if the
whistler were coming nearer up
the street. There is a sharp rap
at the door. Madden starts violently,
and, jumping up, he goes
quickly to the door. He opens it
eagerly and slumps with obvious
disappointment as Edgar Mix enters
breezily. Mix is about twenty-five;
a loosely put together, thin
faced youth in a new suit of readymade
clothes which are of too blatant
a pattern and much too extreme
a cut to be in really good
taste. He is whistling the refrain
of "Tell Me."</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>as he passes</i>]. H'llo, James.
[<i>Without stopping for an answer, he
crosses the room and starts to remove
his hat and coat.</i>] Where's the sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>he has closed the door.
Dully.</i>] She's gone out.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>As if struck by an idea, Madden
reopens the door and goes outside.
He can be seen, looking first to
the left, then to the right, and
finally down at the river before
him. Mix finishes taking off his
outer garments, which he hangs
with a flourish on pegs near the
stove. He is still whistling the
same refrain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix.</span> W'at's a matter with you?
Tryin' t' freeze me out? [<i>His voice has
the same flat quality as his sister's, but it
is full of energy.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Madden does not appear to hear
him. He now comes back into the
house, shutting the door behind
him. His face is anxious, a fact
he tries to hide.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Did you want to see Florence?
[<i>Mix pauses in his whistling.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix.</span> Sure. Nothin' important, though.
Just about a little party she said you an'
she was goin' t' take me on t'night. [<i>He
commences whistling cheerily the opening
bars of his refrain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>dully</i>]. Sorry. I don't know
anythin' about it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mix stops whistling suddenly and
looks down with dismay. Then,
with his hands in his pockets, he
slowly whistles the four descending
notes at the end of the third
bar and the beginning of the fourth.
He stops and shakes his head, then
slowly whistles a few more bars
of the refrain, starting where he
just left off, and letting himself
drop into the morris chair on the
descending note in the fifth bar.
After another brief silence he finishes
the refrain, but with a sudden
return of the same quick, light
mood in which he entered. The
refrain over, he begins again at
the beginning and whistles two or

<p><span class="smcap">Madden.</span> Well ... we did have a

W'at's a use o' takin' it s' hard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>gravely</i>]. The trouble is&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He
breaks off</i>] I guess I was mostly in

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>sitting down vehemently</i>]. Tell
that to a poodle! I know you an' I know

[<i>snapping his fingers.</i>] f'r her, ev'n if she

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>vehemently</i>]. Ed&mdash;if you

W'at y' quarrelin' 'bout? Money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>sitting down again</i>]. Uhuh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix.</span> Huh! Thought as much....
As I was sayin', I know Florrie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span>. It really wasn't her fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>slowly and emphatically</i>]. Well,
you are sappy. Ever'body knows Florrie
spends more money th'n you an' all
my family put t'gether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span>. You wouldn't have me deny
her <i>ev'rythin'</i>?... She's got to have

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span>. But, Lord, man, y' don't earn th'
income of a John D. Rockefeller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>somberly</i>]. I know.... I

<p class="salute">[<i>Mix regards him with a puzzled expression.

<p class="salute">[<i>Madden continues his nervous pacing

<p><span class="smcap">Madden</span> [<i>suddenly</i>]. Was that a footstep?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mix shakes his head. Madden goes
quickly to the window and looks
out. From there he rushes to the
door and peers out, first to one

shuts the door, and with a hopeless

the room. Outside the light is
steadily fading.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>slowly rising from his chair, a
look of still greater annoyance on his

quickly and gets his hat and coat from a

<p class="salute">[<i>Madden goes swiftly across the room
to the door at the back and goes
out. He is seen to pass outside in
front of the back window. Mix
takes a few involuntary steps after
him toward the door, then stops
and gives a low whistle of astonishment.
After a moment he turns
and starts back toward his hat and
coat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>half aloud</i>]. Poor ol' Jim.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He gets his hat and coat, and puts
them on. In the course of a few
seconds the reflective look has gone
from his face; he begins to whistle
softly the same refrain as before.
From his pocket he produces a
cigarette, which he places in his
mouth. He is preparing to light
it when a thought strikes him. He
goes quickly over to the phonograph
and, bending down, takes a
record and examines it. It has become
so dark that he is unable to
read the title; so he lights the
neighboring gas jet. He then
examines two or three records in
quick succession, finally producing
one which causes a smile to spread
over his face.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix.</span> Ah!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He places his find on the phonograph,
winds the machine, and
starts his record playing. The
tune is the same one he has been
whistling the whole afternoon.
With an expression of great pleasure
he hears the record start, at
the same time producing a huge
nickel watch from his pocket and
glancing at it casually. As he sees
the time, his whole expression
changes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> [<i>throwing his cigarette impatiently
on the floor</i>]. Hell!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He stops the phonograph and tilts
back the playing arm. He buttons
up his overcoat, turns up his collar
and adjusts his hat. Then, his
whistle suddenly breaking out
again loudly into his favorite refrain,
he marches quickly across
the room to the door at the back,
and goes out. He is seen to pass
by the window, and his whistling
is heard to die away gradually
down the street.</i></p>

<p class="salute"><i>Stillness has hardly fallen when the
door at the back opens, and Mrs.
Madden enters. She appears a
trifle chilly, but seems otherwise
to have recovered her composure.
Closing the door behind her, she
comes forward lazily to the table.
She looks down at the piles of bills
before her with a perfectly vacant
stare, and taking from her pocket
a pound box of candy she tosses it
down on the papers. She opens
the cover and extracts a large chocolate
cream, which she eats indolently
and with evident pleasure.
Next, she removes her hat and coat,
throwing them carelessly on the
table beside the candy. She walks,
with a lazy, flat-footed step, over
to the gas jet at the right, and
turns up the gas sufficiently for
reading. Looking down, she
notices the record left on the phonograph.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>with slow pleasure</i>].
Hm!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Without bothering to find out
whether or not the phonograph is
wound up, she starts it going and
places the playing arm with apparent
carelessness so that the
record begins playing about a third
of the way through. She listens to
the music for three or four seconds
with an expression of indolent appreciation,
then she crosses the
floor to the door at the left, always
moving with the same flat-footed
walk. Opening the door, she peers
through it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Madden</span> [<i>calling, her flat voice
rising above the sound of the phonograph</i>].
Oh Ji&mdash;im!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She listens a moment for an answer;
but as there is none, she
closes the door and turns around.
Once again the music catches and
holds her attention. She listens
for an instant and then goes back
to the table, making a heavy attempt
at a dance step or two.
From the pocket of her overcoat
she extracts a new cheap novel,
whose content is well advertised by
a lurid colored cover. This she
takes over to the morris chair.
Another thought strikes her; she
tosses the novel into the chair and
goes back to the table, where she
gets five or six chocolate creams
from the candy box, depositing
them in a row on the right arm of
the morris chair. Then she takes
up her book and sits down. For a
moment she tries to read, but all
is not comfortable yet. She
changes her position two or three
times in the chair. At last she
rises, heaving a disgusted sigh.
Dropping her book into the chair
she walks with flat, heavy steps
across the room and out of the
door at the left, leaving it open.
She returns almost instantly, dragging
two greasy looking sofa pillows
after her. She kicks the door
to, and crosses to the morris chair.
Here she places one of the pillows
on the ground for her feet, the
other at the back of the chair.
Picking up her book once more,
she settles back into the chair with
an expression of perfect animal
contentment. She puts another
chocolate cream in her mouth, and
finds her place in the book. Then
the music again engages her attention;
she leans back with a foolish
smile on her face as she listens.
Constantly chewing the piece of
candy, she hums a bar or two of the
tune which is still being played by
the phonograph. Then she settles
down to her reading, eating candy
as she feels inclined. The phonograph
reaches the end of the record
and makes that annoying clicking
noise which shows it should be
shut off. For two or three seconds
Mrs. Madden pays no attention to
it. Finally she raises herself in
the chair, and without getting up
she reaches over and switches off
the phonograph, then settles back
again to her reading.</i></p>

<p class="alignleft">A Play</p>
<p class="alignright">By Hildegarde Flanner</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>In a small town on the southern border
of a Middle-Western state, stands an
old brick house. The town is sufficiently
near the Mason and Dixon line to gather
about its ankles the rustle of ancient petticoats
of family pride and to step softly
lest the delicate sounds should be lost in
a too noisy world. Even this old brick
house seems reticent of the present, and
gazing aloofly from its arched windows,
barely suffers the main street to run past
its gate. Many of the blinds are drawn,
as if the dwelling and its inhabitants preferred
to hug to themselves the old
strength of the past rather than to admit
the untried things of the present.</i></p>

<p><i>The scene of the play is laid in the
living-room. At the back is a wide door
leading into the hallway beyond. At the
left are French doors opening upon steps
which might descend into the garden. At
the right side of the room, and opposite
the French doors, is a marble fireplace,
while on either side of the fireplace and
a little distant from it, is a tall window.
To the left of the main door is a lounge
upholstered in dark flowered tapestry,
and to the right of the door is a mahogany
secretary. Before the secretary and
away from the hearth, an old-fashioned
grand piano is placed diagonally, so that
any one seated at the instrument would
be partially facing the audience. To the
left of the French doors is a lyre table,
on which stands a bowl of flowers. Above
the rear door hangs the portrait of a
man.</i></p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises Harriet Wilde
is discovered standing precisely in the
middle of her great-grandfather's carpet
which is precisely in the middle of the
floor. To Harriet, ancestors are a passion,
the future an imposition. Added to
this, she is in her way, intelligent.
Therefore even before she speaks, you
who are observant know that she is a
formidable person. Her voice is low,
even, and&mdash;what is the adjective?
Christian. Yes, Harriet is a good woman.
But don't let that mislead you.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>calling</i>]. Lydia!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia comes into the room from the
garden. In fact, she has been coming
and going for more than fifteen
years at the word of her aunt, although
she is now twenty-seven.
Her hands appear sensitive and in
some way, deprived and restless.
She is dressed in a slim black gown
which could be worn gracefully by
no one else, although Lydia is not
aware of this fact. In one hand
she carries a pair of garden shears
with handles painted scarlet; in
the other, a bright spray of portulaca;
while over her wrist is slung
a garden hat. During their conversation
Lydia moves fitfully
about the room. Her manner
changes from bitter drollery to a
lonely timidness and from timidness
to something akin to sulkiness.
Harriet, whether seated or standing,
gives the impression of having
been for a long hour with dignity
in the same position. She has
no sympathy for Lydia nor any
understanding of her. There is a
wall of mistrust between the two.
Both stoop to pick up stones, not
to throw, but to build the wall even
higher. Lydia employs by turns
an attitude of cheerful cynicism
and one of indifference, both
planned to annoy her aunt, though
without real malice. But this has
become a habit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> What are you doing, Lydia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I had been trimming the rose
hedge along the south garden, Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> But surely you can find
something better to do than that, my dear.
[<i>She cannot help calling people "my
dear." It is because she is so superior.</i>]
Some one might see in if you trim it too
much. We want a bit of privacy in
these inquisitive times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> The young plants on the edge
of the walk needed sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Move the young plants.
Don't sacrifice the rose hedge. [<i>Pausing
as she straightens the candle in an old
brass candlestick on the mantel.</i>] I&mdash;it
seems to me that the furniture has been
disarranged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I was changing it a little this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> May I ask why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. Oh, just&mdash;just to
be changing. Don't you think it is an
improvement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>coldly</i>]. It does very well.
But I prefer it as it was. You know
yourself that this room has never been
changed since your grandfather died.
[<i>Piously.</i>] And as long as I am mistress
in this house, it shall remain exactly as
he liked it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia looks spitefully at the portrait
over the rear door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>stepping to the window to
the left of the fire-place and lowering the
curtain to the middle of the frame.</i>] The
court house will be done before your
brother is well enough to come downstairs,
Lydia. How astonished he will be
to see it completed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes. But he would much
rather watch while it is being done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Well naturally. But from
upstairs you can't see through the leaves
of the maple tree. Why, Lydia, there
isn't another tree for miles around with
such marvelous foliage. Great-grandfather
Wilde did not know, when he set
out a sapling, that the county court house
was to be built&mdash;almost in its very
shadow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> You always did admire any
kind of a family tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>as if speaking to an unruly
child</i>]. If Great-grandfather Wilde heard
you say that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>with a sudden flash of spirit
which dies almost before she ceases to
speak</i>]. If Great-grandfather Wilde
heard me say that. It may be he would
have the excellent sense to come back
and chop off a limb or two, so that Joe
could have sunlight in that little dark
room up there, and see out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>lifting her left hand and letting
it sink upon her knee with the air of
one who has suffered much, but can suffer
more</i>]. Lydia, my dear child, I am
not responsible for your disposition this
lovely morning. Moreover, this is a fruitless&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Fruitless, fruitless! <i>Why</i>
couldn't he have planted an apple tree?
[<i>Throwing her head back slightly.</i>] With
blossoms in the spring and fruit in the
summer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>wearily</i>]. With blossoms in the
spring and fruit in the summer. [<i>Slowly
and gazing toward the window.</i>] Sounds
rather pretty, doesn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>unsympathetically</i>]. I do
not understand what you are talking
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>shortly</i>]. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> It is always a source of sorrow
to me, Lydia, that you show so little
pride in any of the really noble men in
the Wilde family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I never knew them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> But you could at least reverence
what I tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Well, I do think
great-great-grandfather must have been
a gay old person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Gay old person!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes. The portulaca blooms so
brightly on his grave. It's really not bad,
having your family buried in the front
yard, if its dust inspires a flower like
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I don't see why you insist
upon picking those. They wilt immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>looking appealingly at her
aunt</i>]. Oh, but they're so bright and
gay! I can't keep my hands from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>scornfully smoothing her lace
cuff</i>]. Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>for the moment a trifle lonely</i>].
Aunt Harriet, tell me why these dead old
men mean so much to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. Dead&mdash;old&mdash;men&mdash;?
Why, Lydia? The Wildes
came up from Virginia and were among
the very first pioneers, in this section.
They practically made this town and
there is no better known name here in
the southern part of the state than ours.
We&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Oh, yes. Of course, I've heard
all that ever since I can remember. [<i>Assuming
an attitude of pride.</i>] We have
the oldest and most aristocratic-looking
house for miles around; the rose-hedge
has bloomed for fifty years&mdash;it's very
nearly dead, too; General Someone drank
out of our well, or General Some-One-Else
drowned in it, I always forget which.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Lydia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Oh, it doesn't
make much difference which. That
doesn't worry me. But what does, is
how you manage to put a halo around all
your fathers and grandfathers and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>piously</i>]. Because they represent
the noble traditions of a noble past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> What about the noble present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>looking vaguely about the
room</i>]. I have not seen it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. No, you have not
seen it. [<i>Turning to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Just one moment, Lydia. I
want to speak to you about your brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. Did the doctor say
that Joe is worse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> No. In fact, the doctor
won't tell me anything. He and Joe seem
to have a secret. I can get nothing definite
from the doctor at all. But what
I feel it my duty to ask you, Lydia, is
this: Tell me truthfully. Have you been
speaking to Joe about&mdash;Heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> No. What a dreadful thing
to even mention to a sick boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> My dear, you are quite
wrong. But some one has been misinforming
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Lydia, I am very distressed.
[<i>Slowly.</i>] Your young brother holds the
most unusual and sacrilegious ideas of
immortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. So?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> No member of the Wilde
family has ever held such ideas. It is
quite irregular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> What does he think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I don't know that I can tell
you clearly. It is all so distasteful to
me. But he declares&mdash;even in contradiction
to my explanation&mdash;that after
death we continue our earthly occupations,&mdash;that
is, our studies, our ambitions&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> That is a wonderful idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>not noticing</i>]. That if we
die before accomplishing anything on
earth, we have a chance in the after-life
to work. Work! Imagine! In fact he
pictures Heaven as a place where people
are&mdash;doing things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>lifting her head and smiling</i>].
Oh, that is beautiful&mdash;I mean, what did
you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>reverently</i>]. I explained very
carefully that Heaven is peace, peace.
That the first thing we do when a dear
one dies, is to pray for the eternal rest
of his soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>dully</i>]. Oh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Yes, Lydia, I am glad to see
that you share my distress. Why&mdash;he
desecrates the conception of Heaven with
workmen, artists, inventors, musicians&mdash;anything
but angels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Anything but angels. [<i>Smiles.</i>]
That is quite new, is it not? At least in
this little town. Does Joe see himself
building houses in Heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> That is the worst of it.
Why, Lydia, even after I told him patiently
that there were no such things as
architects in Heaven, he still insists that
if he dies, he is going to be one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>startled</i>]. If he should die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>decidedly</i>]. That is simply
another foolish fancy. He has been confined
so long, that he gets restless and
imagines these strange things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Poor Joe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Don't sympathize with him,
please. I can't possibly allow him to become
an architect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> When the men in our family
have been clergymen for four generations?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, but they're dead now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> All the more reason for continuing
the tradition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> There isn't one bit of money in
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>proudly</i>]. When was a Wilde
ever slave to money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>sulkily</i>]. Certainly not since
my day, and for a very, very good reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Well, at least we have sufficient
to send Joe to college&mdash;and as a
divinity student. And some day we will
hear him preach in the house of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> He would rather build houses
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Simply a boyish whim. He's
too young to really have a mind of his
own. [<i>Confidently.</i>] He will do what I
tell him to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> He is very nearly nineteen,
Aunt Harriet. Didn't you have a mind
of your own when you were nineteen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Certainly not. Yes, of
course.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>the hem of her skirt bellowing
with dignity.</i>] This is entirely different.
If you can't be polite, Lydia, you
might at least stop laughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>still laughing</i>]. Oh, no&mdash;oh,
no&mdash;I take after my great-great-grandfather.
I've just discovered it. At last
I'm interested in the noble men of the
Wilde family. I know he liked to laugh.
Look at the pertness of that! [<i>Holding
up the portulaca.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>ignoring the flower</i>]. Please
give me your sun-hat, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>demurely</i>]. Oh, are you going
to look at the portulaca?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> No. I am going to see what
you have done to the rose-hedge. [<i>Going
out through the French door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>suddenly furious</i>]. Go look at
your decrepit old rose-hedge! Go look
at it! And I hope you get hurt on a
thorn and bleed, yes, bleed&mdash;the way
you make me bleed. I did cut a hole in
it. I don't care who sees in&mdash;I want to
see out! [<i>Looking toward the portrait
and throwing the flowers on the floor.</i>]
Take your stupid flowers&mdash;take them.
They don't do me any good. They're
withering, they're withering!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes to lean against the window
and look toward the court house.
As she stands there, the door opens
slowly and Joe, with blankets
wrapped about him and trailing
from his shoulders, comes unsteadily
into the room. He carries
paper and drawing materials. He
is an eager boy, who seems always
afraid of being overtaken. Lydia
turns suddenly and starts toward
the door. She stops in surprise as
she sees her brother.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Joe! My goodness! Whatever
made you come downstairs? Aunt
Harriet will be angry. Why this might
be awfully dangerous for you, Joe. How
did you come to do such a thing?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She helps him toward the lounge
and arranges a cushion for him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>sinking back, but facing the window</i>].
I wanted to see how the court
house was getting on. I can't see out of
my window, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Well, you see [<i>Raising the
blind.</i>] they will soon have it done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>delightedly</i>]. Yes, won't they,
though. Look at those white pillars!
That's worth something, I tell you. I'm
glad I saw it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Just what I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, but, Joe&mdash;coming down
stairs this way, when you have been really
ill&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Oh, don't argue, Lydia. I have
just been arguing with Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> You'd better rest then. You
will have to, anyway, before you go back
to your room. I see you plan to draw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Yes, I've been lazy for so long.
It's driving me crazy, never doing anything.
I thought I'd copy some Greek
columns this morning. Could you give
me a large book to work on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I'll look for one. [<i>Hunting.</i>]
Joe, what were you and Aunt Harriet
arguing about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, I've heard her do that
before. But won't you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> It wasn't anything, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Here is what you want.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She brings a large bound volume
from the piano and places it upon
his knees.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Thank you. [<i>Settling himself to
draw.</i>] Where is she, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Out looking at the rose-hedge,
where I cut a hole in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> A hole in the sacred rose-hedge!
Where did you suddenly get the courage?
I've heard you talk about doing
such things before, but you never really
did them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. I don't know, Joe,
where I got my courage. I think it's
leaving me, too.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She puts out her hand as if trying
to detain some one.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Come stand by me.
I have&mdash;I have a great deal of courage
this morning.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia stands behind Joe and looks
over his shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>turning to her affectionately</i>].
It's good I have you, Lydia. Aunt Harriet
has a fit every time she sees me doing
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Having them is part of her
religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Well, this is mine. What is
yours, Lydia? I don't believe I ever
heard you say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>shortly</i>]. I haven't any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Sure enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>nodding, then speaking quite
slowly</i>]. I never did anything for any
one out of love, and I was never allowed
to do anything I wanted to for joy. So
I know that I have no religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Never mind. Perhaps
that will all come to you some day.
[<i>Joe suddenly sits erect and looks first toward
the French door and then toward
the window.</i>] I wonder what you will
do when I go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>following the direction of his
gaze</i>]. Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Oh&mdash;to college.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Perhaps when you go to college
I'll do something Aunt Harriet
doesn't think is regular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> What will it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> How can I know now? How
should I want to know?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe looks over his shoulder toward
the rear door of the room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. What do you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Nothing&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Then please stop looking at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>meeting her eyes for the fraction
of a moment and then holding up the
sheet of paper.</i>] I am actually getting
some form into this column. If I could
only learn to design beautiful buildings&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He puts his hand to his side in sudden
pain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>not noting his action</i>]. Why,
of course you will some day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I don't know. Sometimes I'm
afraid I won't get the chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Oh, you'll be a man. You can
ride over Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe looks at his copy and crumples
it savagely. Suddenly he holds up
his hand and listens.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> What was that bell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I did not hear any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> It must have been the side
door. Some one will answer it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Do people often come by the side
door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Why, Joe, you know very well
that the delivery boy always comes there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Delivery?&mdash;I wonder&mdash;will it
be delivery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Joe, you're even odder than I
am. Stop it. It doesn't do to have two
in the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Oh, just as you say.
[<i>Looking at the book on his knee</i>.] What
is this big book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>opening the book</i>]. Why, it has
your name in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> It is my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>in surprise</i>]. Did you ever play
the piano?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>turning aside</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>his face lighting up</i>]. Play something
now, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> That piano has been locked for
fifteen years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Ever since mother died and you
and I came here to live?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes. Haven't you ever wondered
why it was never open?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I certainly have. But Aunt
Harriet always avoided the subject and
I could never get you to say anything
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> By the time I had tried it for
two years, I knew better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> But why is it locked?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Because I neglected my duties.
I played the piano when I should have
been studying, and I played when I
should have been hemming linen, and I
played when I should have been learning
psalms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> But surely when you grew older&mdash;when
you were through school&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> No. I lied to her once about
it. She made me promise not to touch
the piano, and left it open on purpose to
see what I would do. And I played and
she heard me. So when I denied it&mdash;[<i>Shrugging
her shoulders.</i>] You see,
after that, to have let me go on, playing
and undisciplined&mdash;why, it would have
meant the loss of my soul. [<i>Very pleasantly.</i>]
It would have meant hell, at
least, Joe dear, and I don't know what
else. Aunt Harriet has always been so
careful about what I learned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. But surely you are old
enough now to do what you want to!
I'll ask her myself if&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. Oh, no, Joe! Please,
please don't do that. I should be frightened,
really. It is a matter of religion
with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> And don't you know how to play
any longer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, some. I sneak into the
church when no one is there and play on
that piano. [<i>She walks to the instrument,
and sitting down before it, rubs
her palms lovingly across the closed lid.</i>]
When you were away six months ago,
this was opened to be tuned for those
young cousins of hers who visited. They
were lively young girls, and the first
thing they did every morning was to go
to the piano. They would have asked
questions if it had been locked, and Aunt
Harriet hates inquisitiveness like poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Where is the key?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I don't know where it is now.
She has probably thrown it away. It
would be just like her to do it. [<i>Changing
her manner suddenly and rising.</i>]
Joe, wouldn't you like a cup of tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]. No, I wouldn't. Sit
down, Lydia.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia sits down again. Joe starts
to speak, but stops to look about
the room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Joe, what are you looking for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>slowly and reluctantly</i>]. I can't
get over the feeling that I am expecting
some one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>evasively</i>]. I don't know. Some
one I never saw before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. An unknown visitor
knocks before he comes in the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I'm not sure that this one will.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He closes his eyes wearily and puts
his palms before them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Joe, you're tired.
Please go upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Not quite yet. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Lydia,
you know what Aunt Harriet and I were
arguing about. I saw it in your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Of course. It's a beautiful
idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Then you think I'm
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>looking at the piano</i>]. I hope
to Heaven you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>pleading</i>]. Then do something
for me, Lydia, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I've been so worried lately to
think&mdash;how awful it is if a person dies
without accomplishing anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I wish you wouldn't talk like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. I wasn't speaking for
myself. I meant, just generally, you
know. But what I have been figuring
out, is this&mdash;so long as you believe that
you can go on working after you leave
here, it's all right, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>hesitant</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>thoughtfully and as though on
unaccustomed ground</i>]. But when you
first go over, you are rather weak&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> You mean your soul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>speaking hurriedly</i>]. Yes, that's
it. And you mustn't be worried by grief
or any force working against you from
the people you've left behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, I follow you. Where did
you learn all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> In a book at the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>uncertainly</i>]. I think I have
heard of some theory&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. I'm not bothering
about theories. I haven't got time for
them. In fact, I'd almost forgotten about
the whole idea until the other day. Something
the doctor told me set me thinking.
He is really a splendid man, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>indifferently</i>]. Yes, I've always
thought so. But what is it you
want me to do for you, Joe? Aunt Harriet
may come in any moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>looking at Lydia very fixedly and
speaking slowly</i>]. Just this. When I
die, don't let Aunt Harriet pray for my
soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Joe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Yes, I mean it. She has a powerful
mind. And she would pray for my
eternal rest and I might not be strong
enough to stand against her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>starting toward the rear door</i>].
I won't listen to you any longer. It is
wrong to talk and think about death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Lydia, please! It means so much
to me. Listen just one second. I know
I'm not very good, but Aunt Harriet
would be sure to try to make an angel
out of me. And if I thought I had to sit
on those everlasting gold steps and twang
an everlasting gold harp forever and
forever&mdash;Lydia, I'd go crazy, I'd go
crazy!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>His voice rises to a scream and he
sinks back gasping.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>rushing to his side</i>]. I promise
anything. Only don't excite yourself this
way. For Heaven's sake, Joe, be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>insisting</i>]. But don't let her pray.
And make her give you the key to the
piano, and you play something so I can
go out in harmony.&mdash;Harmony&mdash;do you
understand that, Lydia? Harmony.
That's the word they used so often in
the book. Do you promise surely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>tearfully</i>]. Yes, but, Joe, you're
not going to die. You're not! The doctor
would have told us something about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Of course, I'm not going to. Not
until I get good and ready. Don't be
silly. But remember, when it does happen,
you must not cry. That is very hard
on souls that are just starting out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> I&mdash;I can see how it might be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> You won't forget to smile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> But smile now, for practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>trying to smile, but failing</i>].
Oh, I can smile for you easily enough;
but don't frighten me like that again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I'll try not to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>suddenly facing him</i>]. Do you
expect Aunt Harriet to live as long as
you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>with a second's hesitation</i>]. Yes,
I'm quite sure she will. The Wildes have
the habit of living long, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> But why shouldn't you live
longer than she, since you are younger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Oh, I don't know. I'd rather
like to get ahead of her in something,
though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Well, you do believe in preparation.
I can't see why you are being so
beforehanded, but if it gives you any
pleasure to scare me to death&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> It certainly does, Lydia. And
just one thing more, I want of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>rather shyly</i>]. Take the Bible
and read something to bind the promise.
Just any verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> This is becoming too solemn.
I don't care for it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She approaches the lyre table, upon
which, of course, is a Bible, and
opens the book.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Then I'll be ready to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>looking at him sharply</i>]. Go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Upstairs.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia turns the leaves of the Bible.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> This will be our secret, Lydia.
[<i>He leans forward and looks out the
French door, then turns to her impatiently.</i>]
What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Yes, Joe, our secret. Let me
see. Mother was always very fond of
John. [<i>Joe makes a movement of pain,
which Lydia does not see.</i>] Oh, I have
the very thing to read you. How
strange! <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'I'">It</ins> sounds like a prophecy for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Read it. [<i>Steps are heard in the
garden. Joe looks up in alarm.</i>] Who
is that coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Only Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Harriet Wilde comes in through the
French door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I managed, Lydia, to some
extent, to repair the damage which you&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Seeing
Joe, she stops in surprise.</i>] Actually,
Joe downstairs! But I felt certain
this morning, my dear, when you
were arguing in that unheard-of fashion,
that you must be better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. I don't think it has
hurt him to come down, Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> On the contrary, I think it
has done him good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> I should say it did, Aunt Harriet,&mdash;you
don't know how much.
[<i>Again he looks toward the rear door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> What is it, Joe dear? Is the
doctor coming again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> No, I hardly think the doctor
will need to come again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Why, how gratifying. I am
so glad.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Joe closes his eyes wearily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Aunt Harriet, Joe was just
about to go up to his room, but he asked
me to read something to him from the
Bible first. I opened to this passage.
Won't you read it to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Yes, I will indeed. It gives
me great happiness, Joe, to see you really
showing a desire for the holy word of the
Scripture.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Harriet takes the Bible from Lydia
and stands in the light by the
French door. She faces slightly
away from Joe. Lydia walks to
the rear door and stands directly
beneath the portrait. She conceals
a smile and looks expectantly toward
her aunt.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Reading</i>]: Let not your heart be troubled:
ye believe in God, believe also in
me. In my Father's house are many mansions:
if it were not so, I would have told
you. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>sitting erect and interrupting</i>].
Many mansions&mdash;many mansions&mdash;Lydia,
Aunt Harriet&mdash;who said I
couldn't build hou&mdash;houses&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

look at him, but shuts the Bible

sacrilege, Joe.</p>

tip-toes and pretending to dance,
pleased at her aunt's discomfiture.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Aunt Harriet, come here

<p class="salute">[<i>Harriet comes swiftly and stoops

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Joe, Joe!</p>

door</i>]. I'll call the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>standing very straight and
twisting her handkerchief</i>]. It will do
no good, Lydia. Joe has gone. This is
the way your father went and your grandfather&mdash;all
the men in the Wilde family.
But this is irregular. They never
died so young.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Lydia covers her face with her
hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> And he seems so well. Why
didn't the doctor&mdash;Lydia! This was
their secret&mdash;this is what they wouldn't
tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Secret? Which secret?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She looks at Joe and clasps her
hands in anguish. Harriet kneels
by the lounge and begins to pray.</i>]</p>

aunt is saying, runs to her side and

alive. Now that he's dead, let him do
what he wants to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Lydia! You have lost your
senses. Be calm, be calm. [<i>Harriet
crosses to the table and picks up the
Bible.</i>] Come. We will read a few
verses and have faith that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia</span> [<i>snatching the Bible from her
aunt</i>]. No you shan't! Let him alone.
Oh, Joe, Joe, I'm trying. Be brave!
You knew, all along. You were watching,
you were expecting. Why didn't
you tell me? [<i>Lydia looks from Joe to
the piano and back to Joe. She composes
herself and puts her hands on her
aunt's shoulders.</i>] Where is the key to
the piano?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>horrified</i>]. You wouldn't
touch the piano in the presence of death!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Where is the key?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>unable to fathom Lydia's
strange demand</i>]. It is gone. I don't
know where it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> Don't you? Don't you?
[<i>Sliding her hands toward her aunt's
throat and turning toward Joe.</i>] Be
brave, Joe. [<i>Speaking to her aunt.</i>]
Then if the key is gone, I shall have to
take the fire-tongs.</p>

quickly.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They look squarely into one another's
eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>uncertainly</i>]. I can't give it
to you now. I will never give it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span> No? [<i>Almost breaking down.</i>]
Joe, why didn't you tell me? [<i>Walking
toward the hearth.</i>] Very well, Aunt
Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet</span> [<i>passing her hand over her

happen in my house. Lord, what have I

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>The kitchen in the now abandoned
farm-house of John Wright, a
gloomy kitchen, and left without having
been put in order&mdash;unwashed pans under
the sink, a loaf of bread outside the
bread-box, a dish-towel on the table&mdash;other
signs of incompleted work. At the
rear the outer door opens and the Sheriff
comes in followed by the County Attorney
and Hale. The Sheriff and Hale are men
in middle life, the County Attorney is a
young man; all are much bundled up and
go at once to the stove. They are followed
by the two women&mdash;the Sheriff's
wife first; she is a slight wiry woman, a
thin nervous face. Mrs. Hale is larger
and would ordinarily be called more comfortable
looking, but she is disturbed now
and looks fearfully about as she enters.
The women have come in slowly, and
stand close together near the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>rubbing his hands</i>].
This feels good. Come up to the fire,

Now, Mr. Hale, before we move things
about, you explain to Mr. Henderson just
what you saw when you came here yesterday
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> By the way, has
anything been moved? Are things just
as you left them yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> [<i>looking about</i>]. It's just the
same. When it dropped below zero last
night I thought I'd better send Frank out
this morning to make a fire for us&mdash;no
use getting pneumonia with a big case on,
but I told him not to touch anything
except the stove&mdash;and you know Frank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Somebody should
have been left here yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> Oh&mdash;yesterday. When I
had to send Frank to Morris Center for
that man who went crazy&mdash;I want you to
know I had my hands full yesterday. I
knew you could get back from Omaha
by to-day and as long as I went over
everything here myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Well, Mr. Hale,
tell just what happened when you came
here yesterday morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Harry and I had started to
town with a load of potatoes. We came
along the road from my place and as I
got here I said, "I'm going to see if I
can't get John Wright to go in with me
on a party telephone." I spoke to Wright
about it once before and he put me off,
saying folks talked too much anyway,
and all he asked was peace and quiet&mdash;I
guess you know about how much he
talked himself; but I thought maybe if
I went to the house and talked about it
before his wife, though I said to Harry
that I didn't know as what his
wife wanted made much difference to
John&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Let's talk about
that later, Mr. Hale. I do want to talk
about that, but tell now just what happened
when you got to the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> I didn't hear or see anything;
I knocked at the door, and still it was all
quiet inside. I knew they must be up,
it was past eight o'clock. So I knocked
again, and I thought I heard somebody
say "Come in." I wasn't sure, I'm not
sure yet, but I opened the door&mdash;this
door [<i>indicating the door by which the
two women are still standing</i>] and there
in that rocker&mdash;[<i>pointing to it</i>] sat Mrs.
Wright.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They all look at the rocker.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> What&mdash;was she
doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> She was rockin' back and
forth. She had her apron in her hand
and was kind of&mdash;pleating it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> And how did she&mdash;look?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Well, she looked queer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> How do you mean&mdash;queer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Well, as if she didn't know
what she was going to do next. And kind
of done up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> How did she seem
to feel about your coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Why, I don't think she minded&mdash;one
way or other. She didn't pay
much attention. I said, "How do, Mrs.
Wright, it's cold, ain't it?" And she
said "Is it?"&mdash;and went on kind of pleating
at her apron. Well, I was surprised;
she didn't ask me to come up to the stove,
or to set down, but just sat there, not
even looking at me, so I said, "I want to
see John." And then she&mdash;laughed. I
guess you would call it a laugh. I
thought of Harry and the team outside,
so I said a little sharp: "Can't I see
John?" "No," she says, kind o' dull like.
"Ain't he home?" says I. "Yes," says
she, "he's home." "Then why can't I
see him?" I asked her, out of patience.
"'Cause he's dead," says she. "<i>Dead</i>?"
says I. She just nodded her head, not
getting a bit excited, but rockin' back
and forth. "Why&mdash;where is he?" says
I, not knowing what to say. She just
pointed upstairs&mdash;like that [<i>himself
pointing to the room above</i>]. I got up,
with the idea of going up there. I walked
from there to here&mdash;then I says, "Why,
what did he die of?" "He died of a
rope round his neck," says she, and just
went on pleatin' at her apron. Well, I
went out and called Harry. I thought I
might&mdash;need help. We went upstairs
and there he was lyin'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> I think I'd rather
have you go into that upstairs, where you
can point it all out. Just go on now with
the rest of the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Well, my first thought was to
get that rope off. It looked.... [<i>Stops,
his face twitches.</i>] ... but Harry, he
went up to him, and he said, "No, he's
dead all right, and we'd better not touch
anything." So we went back down stairs.
She was still sitting that same way.
"Has anybody been notified?" I asked.
"No," says he, unconcerned. "Who did
this, Mrs. Wright?" said Harry. He said
it business-like&mdash;and she stopped pleatin'
of her apron. "I don't know," she
says. "You don't <i>know</i>?" says Harry.
"No," says she. "Weren't you sleepin'
in the bed with him?" says Harry.
"Yes," says she, "but I was on the inside."
"Somebody slipped a rope round
his neck and strangled him and you didn't
wake up?" says Harry. "I didn't wake
up," she said after him. We must 'a
looked as if we didn't see how that could
be, for after a minute she said, "I sleep
sound." Harry was going to ask her
more questions, but I said maybe we ought
to let her tell her story first to the coroner,
or the sheriff, so Harry went fast
as he could to Rivers' place, where there's
a telephone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> And what did Mrs.
Wright do when she knew that you had
gone for the coroner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> She moved from that chair to
this over here.... [<i>Pointing to a small
chair in the corner.</i>] ... and just sat
there with her hands held together and
looking down. I got a feeling that I
ought to make some conversation, so I
said I had come <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'into'">in to</ins> see if John wanted
to put in a telephone, and at that she
started to laugh, and then she stopped
and looked at me&mdash;scared. [<i>The County
Attorney, who has had his notebook out,
makes a note.</i>] I dunno, maybe it wasn't
scared. I wouldn't like to say it was.
Soon Harry got back, and then Dr. Lloyd
came, and you, Mr. Peters, and so
I guess that's all I know that you
don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>looking around</i>].
I guess we'll go upstairs first&mdash;and then
out to the barn and around there. [<i>To
the Sheriff.</i>] You're convinced that there
was nothing important here&mdash;nothing
that would point to any motive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> Nothing here but kitchen
things.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The County Attorney, after again
looking around the kitchen, opens
the door of a cupboard closet. He
gets up on a chair and looks on a

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Here's a nice mess.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The women draw nearer.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>to the other woman</i>]. Oh,
her fruit; it did freeze. [<i>To the Lawyer.</i>]
She worried about that when it turned so
cold. She said the fire'd go out and her
jars would break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> Well, can you beat the
women! Held for murder and worryin'
about her preserves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> I guess before
we're through she may have something
more serious than preserves to worry
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Well, women are used to worrying
over trifles.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The two women move a little closer
together.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>with the gallantry
of a young politician</i>]. And yet, for all
their worries, what would we do without
the ladies? [<i>The women do not unbend.

his foot against the pans under the sink.</i>]
Not much of a housekeeper, would you
say, ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>stiffly</i>]. There's a great
deal of work to be done on a farm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> To be sure. And
yet.... [<i>With a little bow to her.</i>] ...
I know there are some Dickson county
farmhouses which do not have such roller
towels.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He gives it a pull to expose its full
length again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Those towels get dirty
awful quick. Men's hands aren't always
as clean as they might be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Ah, loyal to your
sex, I see. But you and Mrs. Wright
were neighbors. I suppose you were
friends, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>]. I've
not seen much of her of late years. I've
not been in this house&mdash;it's more than a
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> And why was
that? You didn't like her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I liked her all well enough.
Farmers' wives have their hands full, Mr.
Henderson. And then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Yes&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>looking about</i>]. It never
seemed a very cheerful place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> No&mdash;it's not
cheerful. I shouldn't say she had the
homemaking instinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Well, I don't know as
Wright had, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> You mean that
they didn't get on very well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> No, I don't mean anything.
But I don't think a place'd be
any cheerful for John Wright's being in
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> I'd like to talk
more of that a little later. I want to get
the lay of things upstairs now.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes to the left, where three steps
lead to a stair door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> I suppose anything Mrs.
Peters does'll be all right. She was to
take in some clothes for her, you know,
and a few little things. We left in such
a hurry yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Yes, but I would
like to see what you take, Mrs. Peters,
and keep an eye out for anything that
might be of use to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Yes, Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The women listen to the men's steps
on the stairs, then look about the
kitchen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I'd hate to have men coming
into my kitchen, snooping around
and criticizing.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She arranges the pans under sink
which the Lawyer had shoved out
of place.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Of course it's no more
than their duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Duty's all right, but I
guess that deputy sheriff that came out
to make the fire might have got a little
of this on. [<i>Gives the roller towel a
pull.</i>] Wish I'd thought of that sooner.
Seems mean to talk about her for not
having things slicked up when she had
to come away in such a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>who has gone to a small
table in the left rear corner of the room,
and lifted one end of a towel that covers
a pan</i>]. She had bread set. [<i>Stands
still.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>eyes fixed on a loaf of
bread beside the bread-box, which is on
a low shelf at the other side of the room.

to put this in there. [<i>Picks up loaf, then
abruptly drops it. In a manner of returning
to familiar things.</i>] It's a shame
about her fruit. I wonder if it's all gone.
[<i>Gets up on the chair and looks.</i>] I
think there's some here that's all right,
Mrs. Peters. Yes&mdash;here; [<i>Holding it
toward the window.</i>] this is cherries, too.
[<i>Looking again.</i>] I declare I believe
that's the only one. [<i>Gets down, bottle
in her hand. Goes to the sink and wipes
it off on the outside.</i>] She'll feel awful
bad after all her hard work in the hot
weather. I remember the afternoon I
put up my cherries last summer.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She puts the bottle on the big kitchen

back. The chair which she has
touched rocks back and forth.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Well, I must get those
things from the front room closet. [<i>She
goes to the door at the right, but after
looking into the other room, steps back.</i>]
You coming with me, Mrs. Hale? You
could help me carry them.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They go in the other room; reappear,

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> My, it's cold in there.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She puts the cloth on the big table,
and hurries to the stove.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>examining the skirt</i>].
Wright was close. I think maybe that's
why she kept so much to herself. She
didn't even belong to the Ladies' Aid. I
suppose she felt she couldn't do her part,
and then you don't enjoy things when
you feel shabby. She used to wear pretty
clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie
Foster, one of the town girls singing
in the choir. But that&mdash;oh, that was
thirty years ago. This all you was to
take in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> She said she wanted an
apron. Funny thing to want, for there
isn't much to get you dirty in jail, goodness
knows. But I suppose just to make
her feel more natural. She said they was
in the top drawer in this cupboard. Yes,
here. And then her little shawl that always
hung behind the door. [<i>Opens stair
door and looks.</i>] Yes, here it is.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Quickly shuts door leading upstairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>abruptly moving toward
her</i>]. Mrs. Peters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Yes, Mrs. Hale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Do you think she did it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>in a frightened voice</i>].
Oh, I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Well, I don't think she
did. Asking for an apron and her little
shawl. Worrying about her fruit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>starts to speak, glances
up, where footsteps are heard in the room
above. In a low voice</i>]. Mr. Peters says
it looks bad for her. Mr. Henderson is
awful sarcastic in a speech and he'll make
fun of her sayin' she didn't wake up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Well, I guess John Wright
didn't wake when they was slipping that
rope under his neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> No, it's strange. It
must have been done awful crafty and
still. They say it was such a&mdash;funny
way to kill a man, rigging it all up like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> That's just what Mr. Hale
said. There was a gun in the house. He
says that's what he can't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Mr. Henderson said coming
out that what was needed for the
case was a motive; something to show
anger, or&mdash;sudden feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>who is standing by the
table</i>]. Well, I don't see any signs of
anger around here. [<i>She puts her hand
on the dish towel which lies on the table,
stands looking down at table, one half
of which is clean, the other half messy.</i>]
It's wiped here. [<i>Makes a move as if to
finish work, then turns and looks at loaf
of bread outside the bread-box. Drops
towel. In that voice of coming back to
familiar things.</i>] Wonder how they are
finding things upstairs? I hope she had
it a little more red-up up there. You
know, it seems kind of <i>sneaking</i>. Locking
her up in town and then coming out
here and trying to get her own house to
turn against her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> But, Mrs. Hale, the law
is the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I s'pose 'tis. [<i>Unbuttoning

things, Mrs. Peters. You won't feel them
when you go out.</p>

Mrs. Peters, look at this one. Here, this
is the one she was working on, and look
at the sewing! All the rest of it has been

all over the place! Why, it looks as if she

Mrs. Hale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>mildly</i>]. Just pulling out
a stitch or two that's not sewed very
good. [<i>Threading a needle.</i>] Bad sewing
always made me fidgety.</p>

we ought to touch things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I'll just finish up this end.
[<i>Suddenly stopping and leaning forward.</i>]
Mrs. Peters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Yes, Mrs. Hale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> What do you suppose she
was so nervous about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Oh&mdash;I don't know. I
don't know as she was nervous. I sometimes
sew awful queer when I'm just
tired. [<i>Mrs. Hale starts to say something,
looks at Mrs. Peters, then goes on
sewing.</i>] Well, I must get these things
wrapped up. They may be through
sooner than we think. [<i>Putting apron
and other things together.</i>] I wonder
where I can find a piece of paper, and
string.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> In that cupboard, maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>looking in cupboard</i>].
Why, here's a bird-cage. [<i>Holds it up.</i>]
Did she have a bird, Mrs. Hale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Why, I don't know
whether she did or not&mdash;I've not been
here for so long. There was a man
around last year selling canaries cheap,
but I don't know as she took one; maybe
she did. She used to sing real pretty
herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>glancing around</i>]. Seems
funny to think of a bird here. But she
must have had one, or why should she
have a cage? I wonder what happened
to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I s'pose maybe the cat got
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> No, she didn't have a
cat. She's got that feeling some people
have about cats&mdash;being afraid of them.
My cat got in her room and she was real
upset and asked me to take it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> My sister Bessie was like
that. Queer, ain't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>examining the cage</i>].
Why, look at this door. It's broke. One
hinge is pulled apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>looking too</i>]. Looks as if

don't like this place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> But I'm awful glad you
came with me, Mrs. Hale. It would be
lonesome for me sitting here alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> It would, wouldn't it?
[<i>Dropping her sewing.</i>] But I tell you
what I do wish, Mrs. Peters. I wish I
had come over some times when <i>she</i> was
here. I&mdash;[<i>Looking around the room.</i>]&mdash;wish
I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> But of course you were
awful busy, Mrs. Hale&mdash;your house and
your children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I could've come. I stayed
away because it weren't cheerful&mdash;and
that's why I ought to have come. I&mdash;I've
never liked this place. Maybe because
it's down in a hollow and you don't
see the road. I dunno what it is, but
it's a lonesome place and always was.
I wish I had come over to see Minnie
Foster sometimes. I can see now&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Shakes her head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Well, you mustn't reproach
yourself, Mrs. Hale. Somehow
we just don't see how it is with other

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Not having children makes
less work&mdash;but it makes a quiet house,
and Wright out to work all day, and no
company when he did come in. Did you
know John Wright, Mrs. Peters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Not to know him; I've
seen him in town. They say he was a
good man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Yes&mdash;good; he didn't drink,
and kept his word as well as most, I guess,
and paid his debts. But he was a hard
man, Mrs. Peters. Just to pass the time
of day with him. [<i>Shivers.</i>] Like a raw
wind that gets to the bone. [<i>Pauses, her
eye falling on the cage.</i>] I should think
she would 'a wanted a bird. But what do
you suppose went with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> I don't know, unless it
got sick and died.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She reaches over and swings the
broken door, swings it again, both
women watch it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> You weren't raised round
here, were you? [<i>Mrs. Peters shakes
her head.</i>] You didn't know&mdash;her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Not till they brought her
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> She&mdash;come to think of
it, she was kind of like a bird herself&mdash;real
sweet and pretty, but kind of timid
and&mdash;fluttery. How&mdash;she&mdash;did&mdash;change.
[<i>Silence; then as if struck by a
happy thought and relieved to get back
to every day things.</i>] Tell you what,
Mrs. Peters, why don't you take the quilt
in with you? It might take up her
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Why, I think that's a real
nice idea, Mrs. Hale. There couldn't
possibly be any objection to it, could
there? Now, just what would I take?
I wonder if her patches are in here&mdash;and
her things.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They look in the sewing basket.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> Here's some red. I expect
this has got sewing things in it.
[<i>Brings out a fancy box.</i>] What a pretty
box. Looks like something somebody
would give you. Maybe her scissors are
in here. [<i>Opens box. Suddenly puts her
hand to her nose.</i>] Why&mdash;[<i>Mrs. Peters
bends nearer, then turns her face away.</i>]
There's something wrapped up in this
piece of silk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Why, this isn't her scissors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>lifting the silk</i>]. Oh, Mrs.
Peters&mdash;it's&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Peters bends closer.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> It's the bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. But, Mrs.
Peters&mdash;look at it. Its neck! Look at
its neck! It's all&mdash;other side <i>to</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Somebody&mdash;wrung&mdash;its
neck.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Their eyes met. A look of growing
comprehension of horror.
Steps are heard outside. Mrs.
Hale slips box under quilt pieces,
and sinks into her chair. Enter
Sheriff and County Attorney.
Mrs. Peters rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>as one turning
from serious things to little pleasantries</i>].
Well, ladies, have you decided whether
she was going to quilt it or knot it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> We think she was going
to&mdash;knot it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Well, that's interesting,
I'm sure. [<i>Seeing the bird-cage.</i>]
Has the bird flown?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>putting more quilt pieces
over the box</i>]. We think the&mdash;cat got
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>preoccupied</i>]. Is
there a cat?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Hale glances in a quick covert
way at Mrs. Peters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span>. Well, not now. They're
superstitious, you know. They leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>to Sheriff Peters,
continuing an interrupted conversation</i>].
No sign at all of any one having come
from the outside. Their own rope. Now
let's go up again and go over it piece by
piece. [<i>They start upstairs.</i>] It would
have to have been some one who knew
just the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Peters sits down. The two
women sit there not looking at one
another, but as if peering into something
and at the same time holding
back. When they talk now it is in
the manner of feeling their way
over strange ground, as if afraid
of what they are saying, but as if
they can not help saying it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> She liked the bird. She
was going to bury it in that pretty
box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>in a whisper</i>]. When I
was a girl&mdash;my kitten&mdash;there was a
boy took a hatchet, and before my eyes&mdash;and
before I could get there&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Covers
her face an instant.</i>] If they hadn't held
me back I would have&mdash;[<i>Catches herself,
looks upstairs where steps are heard,
falters weakly</i>]&mdash;hurt him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>with a slow look around
her</i>]. I wonder how it would seem never
to have had any children around.
[<i>Pause.</i>] No, Wright wouldn't like the
bird&mdash;a thing that sang. She used to
sing. He killed that, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>moving uneasily</i>]. We
don't know who killed the bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I knew John Wright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> It was an awful thing
was done in this house that night, Mrs.
Hale. Killing a man while he slept,
slipping a rope around his neck that
choked the life out of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> His neck. Choked the life
out of him.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Her hand goes out and rests on the
bird-cage.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>with rising voice</i>]. We
don't know who killed him. We don't
<i>know</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>her own feeling not interrupted</i>].
If there'd been years and years
of nothing, then a bird to sing to you, it
would be awful&mdash;still, after the bird
was still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>something within her
speaking</i>]. I know what stillness is.
When we homesteaded in Dakota, and my
first baby died&mdash;after he was two years
old, and me with no other then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>moving</i>]. How soon do
you suppose they'll be through, looking
for the evidence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span>. I know what stillness is.
[<i>Pulling herself back.</i>] The law has got
to punish crime, Mrs. Hale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>not as if answering that</i>].
I wish you'd seen Minnie Foster when
she wore a white dress with blue ribbons
and stood up there in the choir and sang.
[<i>A look around the room.</i>] Oh, I <i>wish</i>
I'd come over here once in a while? That
was a crime! That was a crime! Who's
going to punish that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>looking upstairs</i>]. We
mustn't&mdash;take on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span> I might have known she
needed help! I know how things can
be&mdash;for women. I tell you, it's queer,
Mrs. Peters. We live close together and
we live far apart. We all go through
the same things&mdash;it's all just a different
kind of the same thing. [<i>Brushes her
eyes, noticing the bottle of fruit, reaches
out for it.</i>] If I was you I wouldn't tell
her her fruit was gone. Tell her it <i>ain't</i>.
Tell her it's all right. Take this in to
prove it to her. She&mdash;she may never
know whether it was broke or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters</span> [<i>takes the bottle, looks
about for something to wrap it in; takes
petticoat from the clothes brought from
the other room, very nervously begins
winding this around the bottle. In a
false voice</i>]. My, it's a good thing the
men couldn't hear us. Wouldn't they
just laugh! Getting all stirred up over
a little thing like a&mdash;dead canary. As
if that could have anything to do with&mdash;with&mdash;wouldn't
they <i>laugh</i>!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The men are heard coming down
stairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale</span> [<i>under her breath</i>]. Maybe
they would&mdash;maybe they wouldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> No, Peters, it's
all perfectly clear except a reason for
doing it. But you know juries when it
comes to women. If there was some definite
thing. Something to show&mdash;something
to make a story about&mdash;a thing
that would connect up with this strange
way of doing it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The women's eyes meet for an instant.
Enter Hale from outer
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hale.</span> Well, I've got the team around.
Pretty cold out there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> I'm going to stay
here a while by myself. [<i>To the Sheriff.</i>]
You can send Frank out for me, can't
you? I want to go over everything. I'm
not satisfied that we can't do better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> Do you want to see what
Mrs. Peters is going to take in?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Lawyer goes to the table, picks
up the apron, laughs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney.</span> Oh, I guess they're
not very dangerous things the ladies have
picked out. [<i>Moves a few things about,
disturbing the quilt pieces which cover
the box. Steps back.</i>] No, Mrs. Peters
doesn't need supervising. For that matter,
a sheriff's wife is married to the law.
Ever think of it that way, Mrs. Peters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Not&mdash;just that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff</span> [<i>chuckling</i>]. Married to the
law. [<i>Moves toward the other room.</i>]
I just want you to come in here a minute,
George. We ought to take a look at
these windows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>scoffingly</i>]. Oh,
windows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span> We'll be right out, Mr. Hale.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Hale goes outside. The Sheriff follows
the County Attorney into the
other room. Then Mrs. Hale rises,
hands tight together, looking intensely
at Mrs. Peters, whose eyes
make a slow turn, finally meeting
Mrs. Hale's. A moment Mrs. Hale
holds her, then her own eyes point
the way to where the box is concealed.
Suddenly Mrs. Peters
throws back quilt pieces and tries
to put the box in the bag she is
wearing. It is too big. She opens
box, starts to take bird out, cannot
touch it, goes to pieces, stands
there helpless. Sound of a knob
turning in the other room. Mrs.
Hale snatches the box and puts
it in the pocket of her big coat.
Enter County Attorney and Sheriff.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Attorney</span> [<i>facetiously</i>]. Well,
Henry, at least we found out that she
was not going to quilt it. She was going
to&mdash;what is it you call it, ladies?</p>

pocket</i>]. We call it&mdash;knot it, Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A stage only half set for a
morning rehearsal and dimly lighted.
Sud, a successful playwright, enters in a
hurry carrying a leather bag of manuscripts.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Stage Hand.</span> Good morning, Mr. Sud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Good morning, Gus. Just set two
doors; that'll be all I'll need this morning.
We're rehearsing for lines. [<i>Steps
down stage and calls front.</i>] Joe, I'm
expecting a young man, it's all right, let
him in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby</span> [<i>from auditorium back</i>].
I'm here now, Mr. Sud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Come up, Mr. Wouldby. Some
more border lights, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> It's very good of you to let
me in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> I was fond of your father. I
am glad to see his son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> I have written a play, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Too bad, too bad, you make the
price of paper go up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> It must be wonderful to be
the master playwright of our day.
Everybody knows Mr. Thomas Pinikles
Sud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>setting stage</i>]. Yes, it is a privilege
to be a friend of mine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby</span> [<i>pursuing Sud</i>]. Will you
read my manuscript, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Never roll a manuscript. I see
very well you don't even know the first
principles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> How can I learn the first
principles? No one will tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Wait, I will do a great thing for
you, let you stay and see a dress rehearsal
of my latest play, "The Pot Boiler." In
it I have used all dramatic principles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> What are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Well, for instance, this pencil is
the woman in the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> Pencil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> This inkwell is the villain, although
that's really too dark for him.
Deep-eyed villains are out of fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> Inkwell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> The heroine is Miss Ivory paper
cutter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Mr. Ruler is the hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> Ruler!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Other characters enter from stage
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> I haven't finished writing it, but
we're going through it this morning as
far as I have written, then I shall see
how to go on. Here are the players now.
Line up, please, and let me see your costumes.
[<i>He studies them.</i>] Now to
work&mdash;[<i>Rubbing his hands.</i>] to work&mdash;clear
the stage!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mrs. Pencil and Ruler go out left;
Mr. and Miss Ivory and Inkwell
go out right and close the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Mr. Wouldby, if you sit down
here with me, we'll be out of the way.
[<i>Sud and Wouldby sit on two stools way
down right.</i>] You must imagine that this
room is the library in Mr. Ivory's house.
[<i>Sud claps his hands and calls.</i>] Ready.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is a pause, then the door up
left opens and Mrs. Pencil comes
in; her pantomime is as Sud explains
it to Wouldby.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>in stage whisper to Wouldby</i>].
The adventuress&mdash;she comes in&mdash;she
has been cut&mdash;she is worried&mdash;that nervous
twitching of lips and narrowing of
eyes are always full of suspense&mdash;she
takes off her gloves, her hat&mdash;that's good
business. A door opens&mdash;she starts&mdash;by
starting she shows you she is guilty
of something&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory</span> [<i>without hat or gloves enters
from right</i>]. Oh, there you are, Mrs.
Pencil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> Yes, I'm back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> I thought I should have
to drink my tea without you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They sit down to tea&mdash;Miss Ivory
back of table center. Mrs. Pencil
left of table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>in stage whisper to Wouldby</i>].
That tells the audience what time of the
day it is; besides, drinking afternoon tea
shows Miss Ivory is in society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> Isn't your father going
to join us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. That's merely to show
the girl has a father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> No, he is talking business
with Mr. Inkwell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil</span> [<i>starting</i>]. Inkwell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> Yes, do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil</span> [<i>evasively</i>]. I? Oh&mdash;no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> You've heard of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Do you catch it? Do
you see how her nervousness and her few
words at once suggest that there is a
link between Mrs. Pencil and Inkwell?
That's where I show my technique.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby</span> [<i>scratching his head</i>]. Technique!
How can I learn it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> It is the secret that every playwright
locks in his breast. Keep the
young ones out! <i>Mum</i> is the word!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> I am so sorry father has
all this trouble with the brick-layers.
They shouldn't have gone on a strike&mdash;just
now&mdash;when you are visiting
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>to Wouldby</i>]. That tells that
Mrs. Pencil is a guest in Miss Ivory's
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> When you were here last
year my mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. The girl hesitates&mdash;they
both look sorrowful; we had to cut down
the cast, so I killed off her mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil</span> [<i>sadly, with foreign accent</i>].
Ah, my dear&mdash;we were such
close friends&mdash;since my arrival in this
country&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. You see, I had to make
her a foreigner. A villainess always talks
with a foreign accent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> I haven't had much time
to read particulars about the strike.
Does your father still refuse to arbitrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory</span> [<i>haughtily</i>]. What right
have brick-layers to make rules for my
father? He would show his weakness if
he gave in&mdash;I have faith that what he
does is right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>to Wouldby</i>]. The innocent heroine,
so cool and pure and white.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The right door opens and Inkwell
enters&mdash;he starts as he sees Mrs.
Pencil; there is a straight look of
recognition between them which
Miss Ivory does not see.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. That's a dramatic scene.
Doesn't it thrill your spine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> Mrs. Pencil, may I introduce
Mr. Inkwell&mdash;[<i>Inkwell and Mrs.
Pencil bow slightly.</i>] Will you have a
dish of tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Cup, cup of tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory</span>. Dish; <i>dish</i> of tea, or I
quit. [<i>Pause.</i>] Which is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Oh, very well, dish if you like.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Sud's manner indicates he gives in
simply to let the rehearsal progress,
but that he will settle with
Miss Ivory later.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> Please tell me that you
have ordered the strikers to come to
father's terms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Inkwell</span> [<i>at right of table</i>]. He
is looking through his safe for more
papers so he asked me to wait in here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> That's an explanation why he
came in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory</span> [<i>offering cup</i>]. How many
lumps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. That question of the number
of lumps is very important; it gives
a natural air to the scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> I am going to the dining-room
to get some arrack for your tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Inkwell</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Oh, please
don't trouble&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> No trouble at all.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> When you want to get a character
out, you've got to get 'em out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Inkwell</span> [<i>at right of table, to Mrs.
Pencil</i>]. You here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil</span> [<i>at left of table</i>]. Sch!
I had to come! I couldn't live without
you any longer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> But in this house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> I was her mother's
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> You are indiscreet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> I was desperate for you!
You kept putting me off&mdash;when I read

you talk! Do you think I write lines to

they might turn and murder you.</p>

I'll stop this strike as soon as old Ivory
gives me my price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> What do the brick-layers

me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> Pardon me, Mr. Sud&mdash;but
you have me say the brick-layers want
better air. It doesn't sound right. You
see brick-layers work out of doors and
the air there is&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;it's
in no way of criticism, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Come here. [<i>He cuts the line,
using wrong colored pencil first.</i>] Leave
out "light and air." That's a confusion

coming to a big scene! There is nothing
so effective as the repetition of the same
words brought up to a climax. Begin
again, Mrs. Pencil. "Who is spying on
you?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> Who is spying on you?</p>

Parrots! Nothing but parrots! Increase
the stress&mdash;build up the scene&mdash;build&mdash;build!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> How can we build when
you don't give us any lines?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> What do you call yourselves
actors for if you can't supply acting
when the playwright uses dashes!&mdash;This
is the biggest scene in the play. [<i>Crosses
to lower left.</i>] The very fact that I don't
give you a lot of literary lines puts me
in the class of the most forceful dramatists
of the day! My plays are not
wishy-washy lines! They are full of
action&mdash;red-blood&mdash;of flesh and blood!
Now you do <i>your</i> part&mdash;bing-bang stuff!&mdash;shake
them in their chairs out there&mdash;make
shivers run up their spines! Make

say increase&mdash;you decrease;
nothing but animal sounds! Nothing but
a machine! Oh! What's the use! Go

play once we might&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> No back-talk, madam! I haven't

any better, I'll let you out! Show us
what you can do with the rest of the

his chest right the box office will lose
money on you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby</span> [<i>his eyes popping</i>]. Oh!
Must she pound him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Seeing a woman pounding a
man's chest and hearing her scream is
worth two dollars to anybody. Go on,
Mrs. Pencil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pencil.</span> You are keeping something
from me? You have deceived me!
You dog! Tell me! Tell me! Who is

I wrote "applause" here.
You've got to get applause here&mdash;so

the scene to-day? I'll wear a foot-ball
suit to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>in scorn</i>]. Just like an actor to
have a personal prejudice against a part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> I'm not "suited" to it yet&mdash;but
with the proper costume&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>in scorn</i>]. You must not rely on
costume! Think of your art!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> But why must she pound
him so hard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>down left</i>]. Because he is the

get it.</p>

her left</i>]. Who is she? You are keeping
something from me!</p>

him the villain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> I didn't want an explanation
here, so I had to interrupt them&mdash;sch&mdash;here

you, Mr. Inkwell&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell</span> [<i>accepting it</i>]. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory</span> [<i>seated at right of table.

Well, Mr. Inkwell, I hope we may yet
succeed in claiming you as a friend&mdash;instead

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> If you treat all your enemies
so well&mdash;what must you do for your
friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> We abuse those we love.</p>

Quite epigrammatic, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inkwell.</span> Even abuse at such fair
hands could only please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Did you catch the subtlety
of that line?</p>

trumpet calls me into the next&mdash;there I
shall reap the harvest of what I have
sown here. Why should we help the
brick-layers?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Miss Ivory interrupts, "Mr. Sud."</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>waves her silent</i>]. Sch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruler.</span> If they chose in their past life
to be born brick-layers here, have we the
right&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Miss Ivory interrupts several times.
Miss Ivory is on stage left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Sch!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruler.</span> I ask you&mdash;have we the right
to tear down the building they designed
when they were here before? Have we
the right to say to them how they shall
lay the bricks in the foundation for their
next life? Have we the right&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> Mr. Sudd!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>at last in desperation</i>]. Well,
what is it, Miss Ivory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ivory.</span> Excuse me, Mr. Sud&mdash;but
all this time&mdash;while Ruler is talking&mdash;I
don't know what to do with my <i>hands</i>!
Couldn't you <i>cut</i> his lines?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruler.</span> I protest! Mr. Sud, I would
resent having a part shortened on me because
the leading lady doesn't know what
to do with her hands. I really think in
this speech of mine you have shown your
talent. To cut one word of it would do
you a great injustice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>smiles at Ruler</i>]. Thank you!
Quite so! Quite so! Miss Ivory, during
this scene you might be&mdash;you might be&mdash;be&mdash;fanning
yourself&mdash;to keep yourself
the heroine, cool and white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> How well you understand
human nature. The play is really more
important than the players&mdash;isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud</span> [<i>aside. Goes back on stage and
sits next to Wouldby</i>]. Of course, but
actors are so superbly conceited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> I know&mdash;poor things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sud.</span> Mr. Ivory's entrance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wouldby.</span> The girl's father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivory</span> [<i>enters</i>]. I could not find the
papers in the safe, Inkwell. Ah&mdash;how-do-you-do,

<p>[<i>The scene presents an upstairs sitting
room in a comfortable house in a
small city. The wall on the spectator's
left is broken by a fireplace, and beyond
that a door leading into the hall. At the
back of the stage is a deep bay window
from which one may have a view up and
down the street. A door in the right wall
leads to Anne Carey's bedroom. The sitting
room, being Anne's particular property,
is femininely furnished in chintz.
A table desk with several drawers occupies
an important place in the room,
which is conspicuously rich in flowers.</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain rises on an empty stage.
Ruth Carey, a pretty girl of eighteen
years, enters hurriedly, carrying a large
box; she wears a hat and coat.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Oh, Anne, here's <i>another</i> box
of flowers! Anne, where are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice From Anne's Bedroom.</span> In here.
I thought you had gone out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> [<i>opening door left</i>]. I was just
going when the expressman left these&mdash;and
I wanted to see them. [<i>Looking
into the bedroom.</i>] Oh, how pretty your
dress is. Turn round. Just adorable!
May I open these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Voice.</span> Yes, but hurry. It's late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> [<i>throwing her sister a kiss</i>].
You dear! It's almost like having a
fianc&eacute; of my own. Three boxes in two
days! He's adorably extravagant. Oh,
Anne, exquisite white roses! Come, look!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Anne Carey appears in the bedroom
door. She is a girl of twenty-two.
Her manner in this scene shows
nervousness and suppressed excitement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Yes, lovely. Get a bowl, Ruth.
Quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I will. Here's a card. [<i>She
hands Anne an envelope, goes to the
door, then stops.</i>] What does he say,
Anne? May I see?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Anne, who has read the card quickly
with a curious little smile, hands
it back to her without turning.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> [<i>reading</i>]:</p>

<p>
The red rose whispers of passion<br />
And the white rose breathes of love;<br />
Oh, the red rose is a falcon,<br />
And the white rose is a dove.<br />
<br />
But I send you a cream-white rosebud<br />
With a flush on its petal tips,<br />
For the love that is purest and sweetest<br />
Has a kiss of desire on the lips.<br />
</p>

<p>Oh, how beautiful! Did he make that up,
do you suppose? I didn't know he was
a real poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>who has been pinning some of
the roses on her dress</i>]. Any one in love
is a poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> It's perfectly beautiful! [<i>She
takes a pencil and little notebook out of
her pocket.</i>] May I copy it in my "Harold
Notebook"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Your <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I call it my "Harold Notebook."
I've put down bits of his letters
that you read me, the lovely bits that are
too beautiful to forget. Do you mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> You silly child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Here, you may see it....
That's from the second letter he wrote
you from Rio Janeiro. I just couldn't
get over that letter. You know I made
you read it to me three times. It was
so&mdash;so delicate. I remembered this passage&mdash;see.
"A young girl seems to me
as exquisite and frail as a flower, and I
feel myself a vandal in desiring to pluck
and possess one. Yet, Anne, your face
is always before me, and I know now
what I was too stupid to realize before,
that it was you and you only, who made
life bearable for me last winter when I
was a stranger and alone." Oh, Anne&mdash;[<i>Sighing
rapturously.</i>] that's the sort of
love letters I've dreamed of getting. I
don't suppose I ever shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> [<i>still looking over the notebook
with her odd smile</i>]. Have you shown
this to any one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Only to Caroline&mdash;in confidence.
[<i>Pauses to see how Anne will
take it.</i>] But really, Anne, every one
knows about Harold. You've told Madge
and Eleanor, and I'm sure they've told
the others. They don't say anything to
us, but they do to Caroline and she tells
me. [<i>Watching Anne's face.</i>] You're
not angry, are you, Anne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Yes, rather. [<i>Then eagerly.</i>]
What do they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Oh, all sorts of things. Some
of them horrid, of course! You can't
blame them for being jealous. Here you
are having just the sort of experience
that any one of them would give their
eye teeth to have. <i>I'd</i> be jealous if you
weren't my sister. As it is, I seem to get
some of the glory myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>pleads, but disparaging</i>]. But
every girl has this experience sooner or
later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Oh, not in this way. Everything
that Harold does is beautiful, ideal.
Jane Fenwick showed me some of Bob's
letters. They were so dull, so prosaic!
All about his salary and the corn crop.
I was disgusted with them. So was she,
I think, when she saw Harold's letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, you showed them to Jane,
too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> [<i>a bit frightened</i>]. No, really I
didn't. Caroline did. I lent her my notebook
once overnight, and she gave Jane
a peek&mdash;in the <i>strictest</i> confidence. Jane
really needed it. She was getting so
cocky about Bob. Girls are funny
things, aren't they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>who has been keenly interested
in all of Ruth's gossip</i>]. What do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> It isn't so much the man, as
the idea of a man&mdash;some one to dream
about, and to talk about. When I think
of getting engaged&mdash;I suppose I shall
get engaged some day&mdash;I never think of
being really, really kissed by a man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> What do you think of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I always think of telling Caroline
about it, showing my ring to her and
to Madge. Oh, Madge is green with envy.
I believe she thought Harold sort of liked
her. [<i>Anne turns away.</i>] She was so
excited when she saw him in New York.
She said she would have got off the bus
and chased him, but he went into a
house.... Anne, why didn't you tell us&mdash;me,
at least&mdash;that Harold was back
from South America, before we heard it
from Madge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Just because.... I wanted to
avoid all this.... It was hard enough to
have him within a few hours' distance and
know he could not get to me. But it
was easier when no one else knew. Don't
you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Yes, dear, of course I do&mdash;but
still&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. Now, Ruth, it's
quarter past four. You promised&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I'm going ... right straight
off ... unless&mdash;Oh, Anne, mayn't I
stay and have just one peek. I won't let
him see me, and then I'll run straight
away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, for heaven's sake, don't
be naughty and silly! Clear out now,
quickly, or&mdash;[<i>Changing her tone suddenly.</i>]
Ruth, dear, put yourself in my
place. Think how you would feel if you
were going to see the man you loved for
the first time. That's what it really is.
Think of it! Two years ago when he
went away we were just the merest
friends&mdash;and now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> And now you're engaged to be
married! Oh, isn't it the most romantic
thing! Of course you want to be alone.
Forgive me. Oh, Anne, how excited you
must be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>with rather histrionic intensity</i>].
No, I'm strangely calm. And yet, Ruth,
I'm afraid, terribly afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Why, what of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>acting</i>]. I don't know ... of
everything ... of the unknown. All this
has been so wonderful, if anything should
happen I don't think I could bear it. I
think I should die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Nonsense, dear, what can happen?
You're just on edge. Well, I'll be
off. I'll join Mother at Aunt Nellie's.
Give my love to Harold. You know I've
never called him anything but Mr. Lawson
to his face. Isn't that funny? Good-by,
dear. [<i>Throwing Anne a kiss.</i>]
You look so sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>her hands on Ruth's shoulders

Ruth. Good-by.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They kiss. Ruth goes. Left alone,

herself rapidly in the mirror.
There is a sound of wheels outside.
Anne goes to the bay window and

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. Welcome home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Oh, thanks. It's rather nice
to be back in God's country. But it's not
for long this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Are you going away again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Yes. I've another appointment.
This one in India, some big salt
mines. Not bad, eh? I made pretty
good in Brazil, they tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>nervously</i>]. Sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Thanks. Hot for September,
isn't it? Though I ought to be used to
heat by this time. Sometimes the thermometer
would run a hundred and eight
for a week on end. Not much fun, that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>settling back comfortably to
talk about himself</i>]. You know I loathed
it down there at first. What with all the
foreigners and the rotten weather and
the bugs&mdash;thought I'd never get into the
swing. Wanted to chuck engineering for
any old job that was cool, but after a
while&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> How long have you been home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> About three weeks. I'd
really been meaning to come out here
and have a look round my old haunts,
but there was business in New York, and
I had to go South and see my family&mdash;you
know how time flies. Then your
note came. It was mighty jolly of you
to ask me out here. By the way, how
did you know I was back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Madge Kennedy
caught sight of you in New York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Did she really? How is little
Madge? And that odd brother of hers.
Is he just as much of a fool as ever? I
remember once he said to me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, I didn't ask you here to
talk about Madge Kennedy's family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>taken aback</i>]. No ... no,
of course, not. I&mdash;I've been wondering
just why you did ask me. You said you
wanted to talk to me about something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Weren't you glad to
come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Why, of course I was. Of
course. And then your note fired my
curiosity&mdash;your asking me to come
straight to you before seeing any one else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Aren't you glad to be here
with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Why surely, of course, but&mdash;[<i>Pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> You see, people seemed to expect
you would come to see me first
of all. I rather expected it myself.
Don't you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>very uncomfortably</i>]. No....
I'm afraid I don't....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> From the way you acted before
you went away I thought you, yourself,
would want to see me first of all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Before I went away? What
do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> You know well enough what I
mean. The parties those last weeks&mdash;the
theater we went to&mdash;the beautiful
flowers you sent Mother&mdash;the letter&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> But&mdash;but&mdash;why, I was
going away. You and your people had
been awfully nice to me, a perfect
stranger in town. I was simply trying

You don't mean to say you thought&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>watching him very closely</i>].

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Think what? What do you
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, this is terrible! Sit down,
Harold, and listen to me. [<i>She pushes
him into a chair and begins to talk very
rapidly, watching intently the effect of
her words upon him.</i>] You see, when
you went away, people began to say things
about us&mdash;you and me&mdash;about your caring.
I let them go on. In fact I believed
them. I suppose it was because
I wanted so much to believe them. Oh,
what a fool I've been! What a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>after a moment's thought, as if

must stay here. You must pretend for
a few days&mdash;for a week at most, that
we're engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> I can't do that, you know.
Really, I can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>going to him</i>]. Why not? Only
a little while. Then you'll go away to
India. We'll find it's been a mistake.

of course, but at least no one will
know what a fool I've been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>after a moment's hesitation</i>].
Miss Carey&mdash;Anne, I mean, I'll do anything
I can, but not that! A man can't
do that. You see, there's a girl, an English
girl, down in Brazil, I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, a girl! Another! Well,
after all, what does that matter? Brazil
is a long way off. She need never know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> She might hear. You can't
keep things like this hid. No. I wouldn't

you should&mdash;so much! Harold, you
know how dull life is here in this little
town. You were glad enough to get away
after a year of it, weren't you? Well,
it's worse for a girl, with nothing to do
but sit at home&mdash;and dream&mdash;of you.
Yes, that's what I did, until, at last, when
I couldn't stand it any longer, I wrote
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. I never got the letter,
Miss Carey. Honor bright, I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Perhaps not, but you answered
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Answered it? What are you
talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Would you like to see your answer?
[<i>She goes to the desk, takes a

answer. You see it's post-marked
Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>taking it wonderingly</i>]. This

this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>reading</i>]. "I have your wonderful

meant thinking of you, talking of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Rot! Not of me, really.
You didn't think I am really the sort of
person who could write that&mdash;that
drivel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>hurt</i>]. Oh, I don't know. After
a while I suppose you and my dream got
confused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> But it was the rankest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Oh, I'm not so different from
other girls. We're all like that. [<i>Repeating
Ruth's phrase reminiscently.</i>]
We must have some one to dream about&mdash;to
talk about. I suppose it's because
we haven't enough to do. And then we
don't have any&mdash;any real adventures like&mdash;shop
girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>surprised at this bit of reality</i>].
That's a funny thing to say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Well, it's true. I know I went
rather far. After I got started I couldn't
stop. I didn't want to, either. It took
hold of me. So I went on and on and
let people think whatever they wanted.
But if you go now and people find out
what I've done, they'll think I'm really
mad&mdash;or something worse. Life will be
impossible for me here, don't you see&mdash;impossible.
[<i>Harold is silent.</i>] But if
you stay, it will be so easy. Just a day
or two. Then you will have to go to
India. Is that much to ask? [<i>Acting.</i>]
And you save me from disgrace, from
ruin!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Harold remains silent, troubled.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>becoming impassioned</i>]. You
must help me. You <i>must</i>. After I've
been so frank with you, you can't go
back on me now. I've never in my life
talked to any one like this&mdash;so openly.
You <i>can't</i> go back on me! If you leave
me here to be laughed at, mocked at by
every one, I don't know what I shall do.
I shan't be responsible. If you have any
kindness, any chivalry.... Oh, for God's
sake, Harold, help me, help me!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Kneels at his feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> I don't know.... I'm horribly
muddled.... All right, I'll stay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Good! Good! Oh, you are
fine! I knew you would be. Now everything
will be so simple. [<i>The vista opens
before her.</i>] We will be very quiet here
for a couple of days. We won't see many
people, for of course it isn't announced.
And then you will go ... and I will
write you a letter....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>disagreeably struck by the
phrase</i>]. Write me a letter? What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>ingenuously</i>]. Telling you that
I have been mistaken. Releasing you
from the engagement ... and you will
write me an answer ... sad but manly ... reluctantly
accepting my decision....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Oh, I am to write an answer,
sad but manly&mdash;Good God! Suppose
you don't release me after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Don't be silly, Harold. I
promise. Can't you trust me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Trust you? [<i>His eyes travel
quickly from the table littered with letters
and dispatches to the flowers that
ornament the room, back to the table and
finally to the ring that now hangs conspicuously
on her breast. She follows
the look and instinctively puts her hand
to the ring.</i>] Trust you? By Jove, no,
I don't trust you! This is absurd, I don't
stay another moment. Say what you will
to people. I'm off. This is final.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>who has stepped to the window</i>].
You can't go now. I hear Mother
and Ruth coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> All the more reason. [<i>He
finds his hat.</i>] I bolt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>blocking the door</i>]. You can't
go, Harold! Don't corner me. I'll fight
like a wildcat if you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> Fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Yes. A pretty figure you'll
cut if you bolt now. They'll think you a
cad&mdash;an out and out cad! Haven't they
seen your letters come week by week, and
your presents? And you have written
to Mother, too&mdash;I have your letter.
There won't be anything bad enough to
say about you. They'll say you jilted me
for that English girl in Brazil. It will be
true, too. And it will get about. She'll
hear of it, I'll see to that&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> But it's a complete lie! I
can explain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> You'll have a hard time explaining
your letters and your presents&mdash;and
your ring. There's a deal of evidence
against you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> See here, are you trying to
blackmail me? Oh, this is too ridiculous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> They're coming! I hear them
on the stairs! What are you going to
tell them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold.</span> The truth. I must get clear
of all this. I tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> [<i>suddenly clinging to him</i>]. No,
no, Harold! Forgive me, I was just testing
you. I will get you out of this.
Leave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harold</span> [<i>struggling with her</i>]. No, I
won't leave anything to you, <i>ever</i>.</p>

<h4>THE STORY.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>

<p>Of the Princess, we know only that she was fair and slender as the lily, that somehow
the fat and stupid Wazir became her guardian, and that he neglected her utterly
and played chess eternally in the garden with his almost-equally-stupid Vizier. Is
it any wonder she was bored?</p>

<p>One afternoon the Princess called for her ivory telescope, and, placing it to her
eye, sought relief from the deadly ennui which her guardian caused. In the Distance
she discerned a Shepherd, playing upon his pipe for the dancing of his favorite Goat.
While he played the Princess marveled at his comeliness. She had never seen before
a man so pleasing in face and person. At the end of his tune it seemed to her that
the Shepherd turned and beckoned to her. She dared watch him no longer, lest her
guardian observe her.</p>

<p>When the Wazir, the Vizier and the Nubian were deep in their afternoon siesta,
the Princess stole out of the garden with her personal retinue and her small, but
precious hope chests, and set forth toward the Distance.</p>

<p>Now on the highway between the foreground and the Distance lived a wretched
and worthless beggar who had even lost his name and was called Ghurri-Wurri because
he looked absolutely as miserable as that. He pretended to be blind and wore dark
spectacles. The greatest affliction of his life was that his dark spectacles prevented
him from inspecting the coins that fell in his palm, and he received more than his
share of leaden counterfeits.</p>

<p>When Ghurri-Wurri observed the approach of the Princess and her retinue he
reasoned from the richness of their attire that alms would be plentiful and large and
he fawned and groveled before them. The Princess was generous, but she was also
in haste, so bade her attendant give him the first coin that came to hand, and hurried
on.</p>

<p>Ghurri-Wurri's rage knew no bounds. He wept, he stamped, he shook his fists,
he railed, and he cursed. Then, perceiving the Princess' destination, he made haste
to notify her guardian. The Wazir would not believe him at first and the beggar
would have lost his head if he had not happened on the Princess' telescope and
placed it in the Wazir's hand.</p>

<p>Gazing toward the Distance, the Wazir saw the Princess and her retinue nearing
their destination. He lost his temper and did all of the undignified things which
Ghurri-Wurri had done. Then, with the Vizier and the Nubian, he set forth in
pursuit, forcing the reluctant Ghurri-Wurri to guide them. They ran like the wind,
till the beggar gasped and staggered, only to be jerked to his feet and forced on
by the implacable Vizier, who was cruel as well as stupid.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princess arrived in the Distance. The Shepherd, who was as wise
as he was comely, had proper regard for her rank and danced in her honor to his
own piping. They had scarcely spoken to each other when the faithful Goat warned
them of the furious approach of the raging Wazir. The Goat carried the Princess
to a place of safety on his back while the Shepherd stayed to delay her pursuers.
Of the Nubian he made short work indeed, but the Vizier overcame him with his
great scimiter and they led him captive to the garden, leaving Ghurri-Wurri cursing
on the sands.</p>

<p>Arrived at the garden, the Wazir ordered the Shepherd bound in chains and went
on with his chess game. The Shepherd, in a gesture of despair, came upon the
Princess' telescope and, seeking some ray of hope, gazed into the Distance. Here he
saw the Princess and his faithful Goat, who, he perceived, had invented a plan for
his deliverance.</p>

<p>Soon the Princess returned to the garden, disguised as a wandering dancer.
She danced before the Wazir and pleased him so much that he bade her come nearer.
She did so, and bound the Vizier's arms with a scarf, which so amused the Wazir
that he laughed loud and long. Then she bound the Wazir's arms in the same
manner and it was the Vizier's turn to laugh. Into their laughing mouths she thrust
two poisoned pills so that in another instant they fell over, quite dead, amongst the
chessmen.</p>

<p>The omnivorous Goat delivered the Shepherd from his chains with his strong teeth
and they all returned to the Distance, where they still dwell in more-than-perfect
bliss and may be discerned through an ivory telescope any fine afternoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CONCERNING THE SCENERY.</h4>

<p>In the original production by The Washington Square Players, <span class="smcap">The Shepherd in
the Distance</span> was played in front of backgrounds of black velvet. The garden
scene consisted of a black velvet drop about half-way between the curtain and back-wall,
upon which a decorative white design merely suggesting the garden and its
gate was appliqu&eacute;d. This drop was made in three sections, the middle one hung
on a separate set of lines so that it could be raised to show the "Distance" (as seen
through the telescope) without disturbing the rest of the scene.</p>

<p>The "Distance" consisted of a velvet drop hung slightly behind the middle section
of the garden scene, on the middle of which two large, white concentric circles were
appliqu&eacute;d around a circular opening about five feet in diameter. The bottom of the
opening was about eighteen inches above the stage. Behind this stood a platform
just large enough to hold four characters at one time. Black masking drapes were
provided at both sides of the stage and behind the platform.</p>

<p>The Prologue, Scenes II, IV, V, the first part of Scene VII and the Epilogue were
all played before a plain velvet drop hung a few feet upstage of the curtain line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Shepherd in the Distance</span> has also been produced in colors very effectively
by the Hollywood Community Theatre, at Hollywood, California. There is no
reason why any highly decorative treatment of scenery and costuming will not
enhance the production if it be well planned and consistent throughout.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>IMPORTANT PROPERTIES.</h4>

<p>The properties consist principally of a small chess table with most of the chessmen
glued on, two stools, a telescope, a balloon and papier mach&eacute; chain which are employed
as a ball and chain, a very large Chinese crash cymbal for the stage manager's use,
and such personal properties as occur in the text.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>COSTUMES AND MAKE-UP.</h4>

<p>Whatever scheme is selected for the scenery, the costumes and make-up should be
consistent with it. In the original production, all of the characters but the Nubian
were made up completely with clown white or "Plexo," the eyebrows and eyes outlined
in black and mouths rouged but slightly. No unwhitened flesh was visible
at all.</p>

<p>The Princess wore a white satin pseudo-Oriental costume with stiff ruffs at the
collar, wrists and knees, the trousers not gathered at the ankles, a flat close-fitting
turban with a number of ornaments and a hanging veil, and white slippers. In the
dance in Scene VI she used a long black gauze scarf and a white one. Her attendant
wore a similar costume of cheaper material, an unornamented turban and black
slippers. Her slaves were also similarly garbed, in cotton, but with bulkier turbans,
and baggy trousers, gathered at the ankles.</p>

<p>The Wazir, armed with a preposterous "corporation," wore baggy white trousers,
gathered at the ankles, a sleeveless vest with wide, horizontal black-and-white stripes,
a white cloak hanging from his shoulders which terminated in a large black tassel,
a turban, a beard made of several lengths of black porti&egrave;re cord sewed to white
gauze, and white pointed shoes. His bare arms were whitened, his eyebrows were
short, thick and high up on his forehead, and he carried a black snuff-box.</p>

<p>The Vizier's white trousers were not so full as the Wazir's; his tight white vest had
tight white sleeves; his cloak was shorter and without a tassel. His white turban,
however, was decorated with antenn&aelig; of white milliner's wire. He affected high
arching eyebrows, a long pointed nose, a drooping mustache, a disdainful mouth,
carried a white wooden scimiter about four feet long with a black handle and wore
bells on his pointed white shoes.</p>

<p>The Nubian wore black tights and shirt, black slippers and a white skull cap and
breech-clout. The rest of him, excepting his eyes and mouth, which were whitened,
was a symphony in burnt cork.</p>

<p>The Shepherd wore white, knee-length trunks, frayed at the ends, a little drapery
about the upper man, slippers and a cap. His body was whitened profusely and he
carried a tiny flute.</p>

<p>The Goat wore a white furry skin, horns, and foot and hand coverings resembling
hoofs. His make-up approached the animal's face as nearly as possible.</p>

<p>Ghurri-Wurri wore tattered white baggy trousers, vest and cloak, a turban and
black goggles.</p>

<p>The Maker of Sounds was garbed in an all-enveloping white burnous and a white

<h4>A FEW STAGE DIRECTIONS.</h4>

<p>Left and right, in this text, refer to the actor's, not the spectator's, point of view.
The action of the piece is meant to be two-dimensional; the actors are to perform in
profile as far as possible; except when registry of facial expression is important the
action should be parallel with the back drop.</p>

<p>The entire action must be rhythmical and the rhythms should be used as definite
themes, one for the Princess and her retinue, another for the Wazir, etc. The performance
should be extremely rapid and must never drag. The cast should direct
special attention to the comic features, and the director to the pictorial elements
of the piece. The director may consider the performance as an animated poster
which moves rapidly from design to design.</p>

arms full of instruments, crosses the scene and sits with his back against one side of
the proscenium, outside the curtain line. He tries out all his instruments, wind,
string, percussion and "traps." He yawns. He becomes impatient and raps on the
stage.</i>]</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A lower room in Florio's
house. It is wide and simply furnished.</i></p>

<p><i>In the center, at back, is a large doorway,
hung with great black arras. In
the right-hand extreme corner is a small
altar to the Virgin.</i></p>

<p><i>In wall, at back, high up on left, a
small window.</i></p>

<p><i>A smaller doorway, hung with arras of
black, is on the left, well toward the
front. This doorway gives on the study
of the poet.</i></p>

<p><i>At rise of curtain the stage is lit with
the uncertain light of tapers.</i></p>

<p><i>Lizzia, the old servant, is discovered
kneeling at the altar.</i></p>

<p><i>Soon she rises, crossing herself devoutly.</i></p>

<p><i>Demurringly and with deprecating
shakes of the head, she begins hanging
wreaths about the walls of the room.</i></p>

<p><i>After the hanging of each wreath she
crosses herself, and, with agitated piety
verging on superstition, she bends the
knee briefly before altar.</i></p>

<p><i>Now the wreaths are all in place....
Through the small window the grayness
that comes before dawn begins to glimmer
in.</i></p>

<p><i>One by one Lizzia snuffs out the tapers.</i></p>

<p><i>For a moment everything is left in the
gray half-darkness.</i></p>

<p><i>But now Lizzia draws aside the large
black arras in the back. There is revealed
a magnificent panoramic view of
medieval Florence, flushing gradually
from pearl-gray to soft, delicate rose,
then to the full gold of accomplished
sunrise.</i></p>

<p><i>Again the old woman kneels at the
altar.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter, through the open doorway at
back, Violante&mdash;rather tall, good-looking,
quite dark.</i></p>

<p><i>Violante stands silent for a moment.
One can see that it is in her thought to
wait till Lizzia finishes her devotions
... then she becomes impatient and
breaks in on them.</i>]</p>

Our friend Boccaccio, the story-teller,<br />

A group of goodly ladies and gentlemen<br />

Remote from Florence and invisible Death.<br />
There, in green gardens full of birds and leaves,<br />
The blue, cloud-wandering heaven spread above,<br />
We shall beguile the time with merriment,<br />
Music and song and telling of many tales,<br />
Trusting that Death, glutted with multitudes,<br />
Will pass us by.... We need but Florio<br />

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>The studio in Pendleton's
apartment. A large room, with sky-light
in center wall, doors right and left, table
set for breakfast; a vase with red flowers
decorates the table. Center back stage,
in front of sky-light, modeling stand upon
which is placed a rough statuette, covered
by cloth. To one side of this is a
large screen. The furnishings are many
hued, the cushions a flare of color, and
the pictures fantastically futuristic.</i></p>

<p><i>At Rise: Mrs. Abbey, a benevolent looking,
middle-aged woman, in neat clothes
and apron, is arranging some dishes on
the table. Margaret, a very modern
young woman, is exercising vigorously.
She is decidedly good-looking. Her eyes
are direct, her complexion fresh, and her
movements free. Her brown hair is
"bobbed," and she wears a picturesque
Grecian robe.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> Breakfast is ready,
ma'am.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Margaret sits at table and helps herself.
Exit Mrs. Abbey, left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>calling</i>]. Pommy dear.
Breakfast is on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>from without</i>]. I'll be
there in a moment.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Margaret glances through paper;
Pendleton enters, door right. He
is tall and thin, and of &aelig;sthetic
appearance. His long blond hair
is brushed loosely over his forehead
and he is dressed in a helitrope-colored
dressing gown. He lights
a cigarette.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I thought you were going
to stop smoking before breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> My dear, I can't possibly
stand the taste of tooth paste in my
mouth all day.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pendleton sits at table. Enters
Mrs. Abbey with tray. Pendleton
helps himself, then drops his knife
and fork with a clang. Mrs.
Abbey and Margaret are startled.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> Anything the matter,
sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Dear, dear! My breakfast
is quite spoiled again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey</span> [<i>concerned</i>]. Spoiled, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>pointing to red flowers on
breakfast table</i>]. Look at those flowers,
Mrs. Abbey. Not only are they quite
out of harmony with the color scheme
in this room, but they're positively red,
and you know I have a perfect horror of
red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> But you like them that
color sometimes, sir. What am I to do
when you're so temperamental about
'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Temperamental. I should
say bad-tempered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Oh no,
ma'am. It isn't bad temper. I understand
Mr. Pendleton. It's just another
bad night he's had, that's what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>sarcastically polite</i>]. Mrs.
Abbey, you appear to have an intimate
knowledge of how I pass the nights. It's
becoming quite embarrassing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> You mustn't mind an old
woman like me, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The sound of a piano hopelessly out
of tune, in the apartment upstairs,
is heard, the player banging out
Mendelssohn's Wedding March
with unusual insistence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> There! That confounded
piano again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> And they always play the
Wedding March. There must be an old
maid living there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> They're doing that for a
reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> Their cook tole me yesterday
that her missus thinks if she keeps
on a-playing of the Wedding March,
p'raps it'll give you an' Mr. Pendleton
the idea of getting married. She don't
believe in couples livin' to-gether, like
you an' Mr. Pendleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> And I just said you an'
Mr. Pendleton had been living together
so long, it was my opinion you might just
as well be married an' done with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Your opinion is
quite uncalled for, Mrs. Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Why shouldn't Mrs.
Abbey give us her opinion? It may be
valuable. Look at her experiences in
matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> In matrimony, and out
of it, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>sitting</i>]. But Mrs. Abbey
has no right to discuss our affairs with
other people's maids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> I'll be glad to quit if I
don't suit the mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. There! Mistress
again! How often have I asked you not
to refer to me as the mistress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> No offense, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> You'd better see if there's
any mail, Mrs. Abbey, and take those
flowers away with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> Very well, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit Mrs. Abbey door center.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What an old-fashioned
point of view Mrs. Abbey has.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pendleton takes up paper and commences
to read.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Pommy, why do you stoop
so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Am I stooping?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I'm tired of telling you.
You ought to take more exercise.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pendleton continues to read.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> One reason why the Greeks
were the greatest of artists was because
they cultivated the body as carefully as
the mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Oh! Hang the Greeks!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter Mrs. Abbey right, with letters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> There are your letters,
sir. [<i>Coldly.</i>] And these are yours,
ma'am.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit Mrs. Abbey left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>who has opened her letters
meanwhile</i>]. How delightful! Tom Del
Valli has asked us to a party at his
studio next Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>opening his letters</i>]. Both
of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>giving him letter</i>]. Yes,
and Helen Marsden wants us for Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Both of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>picking up another letter</i>].
Yes, and here's one from Bobby Watson
for Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Both of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Really, Margaret, this is
becoming exasperating. [<i>Holds up letters.</i>]
Here are four more, I suppose
for both of us. People keep on inviting
us out together time after time as though
we were the most conventional married
couple on God's earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Do you object to going out
with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]. No, it isn't
that. But we're having too much of a
good thing. And I've come to the conclusion
that it's your fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. Oh! it's my
fault? Of course you'd blame me. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Because you have such an
absurd habit of boasting to people of your
devotion for me, when we're out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You surely don't expect me
to quarrel with you in public?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It isn't necessary to go
to that extent. But then everybody believes
that we're utterly, almost stupidly
in love with one another, what can you
expect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You said once you never
wanted me to suppress anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> That was before we began
to live together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What could I have done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>up right</i>]. Anything just
so we could have a little more freedom
instead of being tied to one another the
way we are. Never a moment when we're
not together, never a day when I'm not
interviewed by special article writers
from almost every paper and magazine
in the country, as the only successful exponent
of the theory that love can be so
perfect that the marriage contract degrades
it. I put it to you, Margaret, if
this is a free union it is simply intolerable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But aren't we living together
so as to have more freedom?
Think of what it might be if we were
married. Didn't you once write that
"When marriage comes in at the door,
freedom flies out at the window"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Are we any better off,
with everybody treating us as though we
were living together to prove a principle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Well, aren't we incidently?
You said so yourself. We can be a beautiful
example to other people, and show
them how to lead the pure natural lives
of the later Greeks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Damn the later Greeks!
Why do you always throw those confounded
later Greeks in my face? We've
got to look at it from our standpoint.
This situation must come to an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What can we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It rests with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> With me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> You can compromise
yourself with somebody publicly. That'll
put an end to everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> How will that end it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It'll break down the morally
sanctified atmosphere in which we're
living. Then perhaps, people will regard
us as immoral and treat us like decent
human beings again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But I don't want to compromise
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> If you believe in your
own ideas, you must.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But why should I have to
do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It will be so easy for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Why can't we both be compromised?
That would be better still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> I should find it a bore.
You, unless my memory fails me, would
enjoy it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> You needn't be cynical.
Even if you don't enjoy it, you can work
it into a novel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It's less exertion to imagine
an affair of that sort, and the result
would probably be more saleable. Besides
I have no interest whatsoever in
women, at least, in the women we know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> For that matter, I don't
know any eligible men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> What about Bob Lockwood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But he's your best friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Exactly&mdash;no man ever
really trusts his best friend. He'll probably
compromise you without compunction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I'm afraid he'd be too dangerous&mdash;he
tells you all his secrets.
Whom will you choose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> It's a matter of complete
indifference to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I've heard a lot of queer
stories about Jean Roberts. How would
she do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. Margaret, I
don't mind being party to a flirtation&mdash;but
I draw the line at being the victim
of a seduction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Why not leave it to chance?
Let it be the next interesting woman you
meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> That might be amusing.
But there must be an age limit. And
how about you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>takes cloth off statuette
and discloses figure of Apollo in rough
modeling clay</i>]. Me! Why not the new
model who is coming to-day to pose for
my Apollo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Well, if he's anything like
that, you ought to be able to create a
sensation. Then, perhaps, we shall have
some real freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Pommy, do you still love
me as much as you did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> How you sentimentalize!
Do you think I'd be willing to enter into
a flirtation with a strange woman, if I
didn't want to keep on living with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> And we won't have to break
up our little home, will we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> No, anything to save the
home. [<i>Catches himself.</i>] My God! If
any of my readers should hear me say
that! To think that I, Pomeroy Pendleton,
should be trying to save my own
home. And yet, how characteristically
paradoxical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. You are
going to philosophize! Give me a kiss.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes to him, sits on his lap, and
places her arm on his shoulder; he
takes out cigarette, she lights it for
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>brought back to reality</i>].
I have some work to do&mdash;I must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> A kiss!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>kisses her carelessly</i>].
There let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I want a real kiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Don't be silly, dear, I
can't play this morning. I've simply got
to finish my last chapter.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A bell rings, Mrs. Abbey enters and
goes to door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Abbey.</span> There's a lady to see Mr.
Pendleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Tell her to come in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> But, Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Remember! [<i>Significantly.</i>]
The first woman you meet!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit Margaret. Mrs. Abbey enters
with Baroness de Meauville. Exit
Mrs. Abbey.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness de Meauville</span> [<i>speaking with
a pronounced English accent</i>]. Good
morning, Mr. Pendleton, I'm the Baroness
de Meauville!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>recalling her name</i>].
Baroness de Meauville? Ah, the costumiere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Not a costumiere, Mr. Pendleton,
I am an artist, an artist in modern
attire. A woman is to me what a canvas
is to a painter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Excuse me for receiving
you in my dressing gown. I was at work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> I like to see men in dressing
gowns&mdash;yours is charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>flattered and pleased</i>].
Do you like it? I designed it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>looking seductively into his
eyes</i>]. How few really creative artists
there are in America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>modestly</i>]. You flatter
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Not at all. You must
know that I'm a great admirer of yours,
Mr. Pendleton. I've read every one of
your books. I feel I know you as an old
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> That's very nice of you!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Baroness reclines on couch;

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Will you smoke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Thanks.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pendleton lights her cigarette, then
his own. He draws his chair up
to the couch. An atmosphere of
mutual interest is established.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Mr. Pendleton, I have a
mission in life. It is to make the American
woman the best dressed woman in
the world. I came here to-day because
I want you to help me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> But I have no ambitions
in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Why should you have ambitions?
Only the bourgeoisie have ambitions.
We artists have inspirations. I
want to breathe into you the spirit of my
great undertaking. Already I have
opened my place in the smartest part of
the Avenue. Already I have drawn my
assistants from all parts of the world.
Nothing is lacking to complete my plans
but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Me? Why me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>endearingly</i>]. Are you not
considered one of the foremost men of
letters in America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>modestly</i>]. Didn't you
say you had read all my books?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Are you not the only writer
who has successfully portrayed the emotional
side of American life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>decidedly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Exactly. That is why I
have chosen you to write my advertisements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>aghast</i>]. But, Baroness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> You're not going to say
that. It's so ordinary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> But, but, you want me to
write advertisements!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Please don't disappoint
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Yes, I suppose that's so.
But one has a sense of pride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Art comes before Pride.
Consider my feelings, an aristocrat, coming
here to America and engaging in
commerce, and advertising, and other
dreadful things, and all for the sake of
Art!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> But you make money out
of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Only incidentally. Just as
you, in writing my advertisements, would
make, say ten thousand or so, as a sort
of accident. But don't let us talk of
money. It's perfectly revolting, isn't it?
Art is Life, and I believe in Life for
Art's sake. That's why I'm a success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Indeed? How interesting.
Please go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> When a woman comes to
me for a gown, I don't measure body,
why should I? I measure her mind. I
find her color harmony. In a moment
I can tell whether she ought to wear
scarlet, mauve, taupe, magenta, or any
other color, so as to fall into her proper
rhythm. Every one has a rhythm, you
know. [<i>Pendleton sits on sofa.</i>] But I
don't have to explain all this to you, Mr.
Pendleton. You understand it intuitively.
This heliotrope you are wearing
shows me at once that you are in rhythm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>thinks of Margaret</i>]. I'm
not so sure that I am. What you say
interests me. May I ask you a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Yes, but I may not answer
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Why do you wear heliotrope
and the same shade as mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>with mock mystery</i>]. You
mustn't ask me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> I'm all curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Curiosity is dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Supposing I try to find
out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> That may be even more
dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> I'm fond of that kind of
danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Take care! I'm very fragile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Isn't heliotrope in rhythm
with the faint reflection of passion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> How brutal of you to have
said it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>coming closer to her</i>]. I,
too, am in rhythm with heliotrope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>with joy</i>]. How glad I am.
Thank God you've no desire to kiss my
lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Only your finger-tips.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They exchange kisses on finger-tips.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Your fingers are like
soft, pale, waxen tapers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Your kisses are the breathings
that light them into quivering
flame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Exquisite&mdash;exquisite!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>withdrawing her hands</i>].
That was a moment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> We must have many such.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Many? That's too near
too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>feverishly</i>]. We shall,
dear lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> How I adore your writings!
They have made me realize the
beauty of an ideal union, the love of
one man for one woman at a time. Let
us have such a union, you and me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton</span> [<i>taken back</i>]. But I live
in such a union already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>rising in amazement</i>]. And
only a moment ago you kissed me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Well&mdash;what of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Don't you see what we've
done? You are living in one of those
wonderful unions you describe in your
books&mdash;and I've let you kiss me. I've
committed a sacrilege.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> You're mistaken. It isn't
a sacrilege. It's an opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness</span> [<i>dramatically</i>]. How can
you say that&mdash;you whose words have inspired
my deepest intimacies. No, I
must go. [<i>Makes for the door.</i>] I&mdash;must&mdash;go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> You don't understand. I
exaggerated everything so in my confounded
books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Please ask her to forgive
me. Please tell her I thought you were
married, otherwise, never, never, would
I have permitted you to kiss me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> What made you think I
was married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> One often believes what
one hopes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> You take it too seriously.
Let me explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> What is there to explain?
Our experience has been complete. Why
spoil it by anti-climax?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendleton.</span> Am I never to see you
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baroness.</span> Who knows? If your present
union should end, and some day your
soul needs&mdash;some one?</p>

Well, I don't know. It's kind of chilly

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> If I draped you, it would

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton</span> [<i>relieved</i>]. Ah, now you're

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> So, you'll really come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Splendid! Sit down. [<i>Fenton

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Is it difficult?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> Not if you've got personality,

If a feller hasn't got personality,
he can't sell goods, that's sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> What do you mean by personality,
Mr. Fenton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> Well, it's what sells the
goods. I don't know how else to explain
it exactly. I'll look it up in the dictionary.
[<i>Takes dictionary and turns pages.</i>]
Here it is, ma'am. Per&mdash;per&mdash;why, it
isn't in here. I guess they don't put in
words that everybody knows. We all

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> [<i>flirtingly</i>]. They lack the

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> I believe you are kidding
me. Does that mean you like me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> That's rather an embarrassing

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> You must or you wouldn't
let me speak to you this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But he doesn't keep me.
I keep myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> Wait a minute. You support

Good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> But I can explain everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenton.</span> It's no use, Miss. Even
though I am a salesman, I've got a sense
of honor. I sized you up as a married

a stage set for a Harlequinade, a merry
black and white interior. Directly behind
the footlights, and running parallel with
them, is a long table, covered with a gay
black and white cloth, on which is spread
a banquet. At the opposite ends of this
table, seated on delicate thin-legged
chairs with high backs, are Pierrot and
Columbine, dressed according to the tradition,
excepting that Pierrot is in lilac,
and Columbine in pink. They are dining.</i>]</p>

What's that to do with the price of furs?&mdash;You're blonde,<br />

Can't act! You under-rate yourself, my dear!</p>

I'll teach you how to cry, and how to die,<br />

But why?</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Pier.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">But why?&mdash;well, as to that, my dear,</span><br />
I cannot say. It's just a matter of form.</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Colu.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Pierrot, I'm getting tired of caviar</span><br />
And peacocks' livers. Isn't there something else<br />
That people eat?&mdash;some humble vegetable,<br />
That grows in the ground?</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Pier.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Well, there are mushrooms.</span></p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Colu.</span>                 <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Mushrooms!</span><br />
That's so! I had forgotten ... mushrooms ... mushrooms....<br />
I cannot <i>live</i> with.... How do you like this gown?</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Pier.</span> Not much. I'm tired of gowns that have the waist-line<br />
About the waist, and the hem around the bottom,&mdash;<br />
And women with their breasts in front of them!&mdash;<br />
<i>Zut</i> and <i>eh&eacute;</i>! Where does one go from here!</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Colu.</span> Here's a persimmon, love. You always liked them.</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Pier.</span>       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I am become a critic; there is nothing I can enjoy.... However, set it aside;</span><br />
I'll eat it between meals.</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Colu.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Pierrot, do you know,</span><br />
Sometimes I think you're making fun of me.</p>

<p class="pchar">
<span class="smcap">Pier.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Of course not.</span><br />
There never was. "Moon's" just a word to swear by,<br />
"Mutton!"&mdash;now <i>there's</i> a thing you can lay the hands on,<br />

I always lied about the moon and you.<br />
Food is my only lust.</p>

<span class="smcap">Colu.</span>      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Well, eat it, then,</span><br />
For heaven's sake, and stop your silly noise!<br />
I haven't heard the clock tick for an hour.</p>

<p class="pchar">

<h2>HELENA'S HUSBAND</h2>

<p class="alignleft">An Historical Comedy</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span> <i>is that archaeological mystery,
a Greek interior. A door on the right
leads to the King's library, one on the
left to the apartment of the Queen.
Back right is the main entrance leading
to the palace. Next this, running the
full length of the wall, is a window with
a platform, built out over the main court.
Beyond is a view of hills bright with
lemon groves, and in the far distance
shimmers the sea. On the wall near the
Queen's room hangs an old shield rusty
with disuse. A bust of Zeus stands on a
pedestal against the right wall. There
are low coffers about the room from
which hang the ends of vivid colored
robes. The scene is bathed in intense
sunlight. Tsumu is massaging the
Queen.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> There's no doubt about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> Analytikos says there is much
doubt about all things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Never mind what he says.
I envy you your complexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>falling prostrate before Helena</i>].
Whom the Queen envies should beware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. Get up, Tsumu.
You make me nervous tumbling about
like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>still on floor</i>]. Why does the
great Queen envy Tsumu?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Get up, you silly. [<i>She
kicks her.</i>] I envy you because you can
run about and never worry about getting
sunburnt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>on her knees</i>]. The radiant
beauty of the Queen is unspoilable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That's just what's worrying
me, Tsumu. When beauty is so perfect
the slightest jar may mean a jolt. [<i>She
goes over and looks at her reflection in
the shield.</i>]  I can't see myself as well
as I would like to. The King's shield is
tarnished. Menelaus has been too long
out of battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>handing her a hand mirror</i>].
The Gods will keep Sparta free from
strife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span>. I'll have you beaten if you
assume that prophetic tone with me.
There's one thing I can't stand, and that's
a know-all.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Flinging the hand mirror to the
floor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>in alarm</i>]. Gods grant you
haven't bent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> These little mirrors are useless.
His shield is the only thing in
which I can see myself full-length. If he
only went to war, he'd have to have it
cleaned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>putting the mirror on a table
near the Queen</i>]. The King is a lover of
peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The King is a lover of comfort.
Have you noticed that he spends
more time than he used to in the library?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> He is busy with questions of
State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You know perfectly well that
when anything's the matter with the Government
it's always straightened out at
the other end of the palace. Finish my
shoulder. [<i>She examines her arm.</i>] I
doubt if there is a finer skin than this in
Sparta.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tsumu begins to massage the Queen's
shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>taking up a mirror</i>]. That
touch of deep carmine right here in the
center of my lips was quite an idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>busily pounding the Queen</i>].
An inspiration of the Gods!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The Gods have nothing to do
with it. I copied it from a low woman
I saw at the circus. I can't understand
how these bad women have such good
ideas.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Helen twists about.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> If your majesty doesn't sit
still, I may pinch you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>boxing her ears</i>]. None of
your tricks, you ebony fiend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>crouching</i>]. Descendant of
paradise, forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> If you bruise my perfect
flesh, the King will kill you. My beauty
is his religion. He can sit for hours, as
if at prayer, just examining the arch of
my foot. Tsumu, you may kiss my foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>prostrate</i>]. May the Gods
make me worthy of your kindness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That's enough. Tsumu, are
you married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. I've been so busy
having babies I never had time to get
married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It's a great disillusionment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>agast</i>]. What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I'm not complaining. Moo
Moo is the best of husbands, but sometimes
being adored too much is trying.
[<i>She sighs deeply.</i>] I think I'll wear my
heliotrope this afternoon.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A trumpet sounds below in the
courtyard. Tsumu goes to the
window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> They are changing the guards
at the gates of the palace. It's almost
time for your bath.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She begins scraping the massage
ointment back into the box.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You're as careful with that
ointment as Moo Moo is with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> Precious things need precious
guarding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It's very short-sighted on
Moo Moo's part to send everybody to the
galleys who dares lift a head when I
pass by&mdash;and all these nice-looking soldiers!
Why&mdash;the only men I ever see
besides Moo Moo are Analytikos and a
lot of useless eunuchs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> Oh, those eunuchs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>as she sits dreaming</i>]. I wish,
I wish&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stops short.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> You have but to speak your
desire to the King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. Tsumu! How
can you think of such a thing? I'm not
a bad woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> He would die for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>relieved</i>]. Ah! Do you
think so, Tsumu?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> All Sparta knows that His
Majesty is a lover of peace, and yet he
would rush into battle to save you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I should love to have men
fighting for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>in high alarm</i>]. May Zeus
turn a deaf ear to your voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don't be impertinent, Tsumu.
I've got to have some sort of amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> You've only to wait till next
week, and you can see another of the
priestesses sacrificed to Diana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That doesn't interest me any
longer. The girls are positively beginning
to like it. No! My mind is set on
war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>terrified</i>]. I have five fathers
of my children to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> War, or&mdash;or&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>hopefully</i>]. Have I been so
long your slave that I no longer know
your wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>very simply</i>]. Well, I should
like to have a lover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu</span> [<i>springs up and rushes over in
horror to draw the curtains across the
door of the library. All of a tremble</i>].
Gods grant they didn't hear you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don't be alarmed, Tsumu.
Analytikos is over eighty.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She bursts into a loud peal of laughter
and Menelaus rushes into the
room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>in high irritation</i>]. I wish
you wouldn't make so much noise in here.
A King might at least expect quiet in his
own palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Tsumu, see if my bath is
ready. [<i>Tsumu exits.</i>] You used not
speak like that to me, Moo Moo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>in a temper</i>]. How many
times must I tell you that my name is
Menelaus and that it isn't "Moo Moo"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>sweetly</i>]. I'll never do it
again, Moo Moo. [<i>She giggles.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Your laugh gets on my
nerves. It's louder than it used to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> If you wish it, I'll never,
never laugh again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> You've promised that too
often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. Things are not as
they used to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Are you going to start that
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>with a tinge of melancholy</i>].
I suppose you'd like me to be still and
sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. Is it too much to
hope that you might be still and happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>speaking very quickly and
tragically</i>]. Don't treat me cruelly, Moo
Moo. You don't understand me. No
man ever really understands a woman.
There are terrible depths to my nature.
I had a long talk with Dr. &AElig;sculapius
only last week, and he told me I'm too
introspective. It's the curse of us emotional
women. I'm really quite worried,
but much you care, much you care. [<i>A
note of tears comes into her voice.</i>] I'm
sure you don't love me any more, Moo
Moo. No! No! Don't answer me! If
you did you couldn't speak to me the
way you do. I've never wronged you
in deed or in thought. No, never&mdash;never.
I've given up my hopes and aspirations,
because I knew you wanted me
around you. And now, NOW&mdash;[<i>She
can contain the tears no longer.</i>] Because
I have neglected my beauty and
because I am old and ugly, you regret
that Ulysses or Agamemnon didn't marry
me when you all wanted me, and I know
you curse the day you ever saw me.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She is breathless.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>fuming</i>]. Well! Have you
done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No. I could say a great deal
more, but I'm not a talkative woman.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Analytikos comes in from the library.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Your Majesty, are we to
read no longer to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I have something to say to
the King.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Analytikos goes toward the library.
Menelaus anxiously stops him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> No. Stay here. You are
a wise man and well understand the wisdom
of the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>bowing to Helena</i>]. Helena
is wise as she is beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> She is attempting to prove
to me in a thousand words that she's a
silent woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Women are seldom silent.
[<i>Helen resents this.</i>] Their beauty
is forever speaking for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The years have, indeed,
taught you wisdom.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tsumu enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> The almond water awaits
your majesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I hope you haven't forgotten
the chiropodist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsumu.</span> He has been commanded but
he's always late. He's so busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>in a purring tone to Menelaus</i>].
Moo Moo.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Menelaus, bored, turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>to Tsumu</i>]. I think after all
I'll wear my Sicily blue.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She and Tsumu go into the Queen's
apartment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Shall we go back to the
library?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> My mind is unhinged
again&mdash;that woman with her endless protestations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> I am sorry the poets no
longer divert you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> A little poetry is always
too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> To-morrow we will try
the historians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> No! Not the historians.
I want the truth for a change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> The truth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Where in books can I find
escape from the grim reality of being
hitched for life to such a wife? Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Philosophy teaches&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Why have the Gods made
woman necessary to man, and made them
fools?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> For seventy years I have
been resolving the problem of woman
and even at my age&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Give it up, old man. The
answer is&mdash;don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Such endless variety,
and yet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>with the conviction of finality</i>].
There are only two sorts of women!
Those who are failures and those who
realize it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Is not Penelope, the
model wife of your cousin Ulysses, an
exception?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Duty is the refuge of the
unbeautiful. She is as commonplace as
she is ugly. [<i>And then with deep bitterness.</i>]
Why didn't <i>he</i> marry Helen when
we all wanted her? He was too wise for
that. He is the only man I've ever known
who seems able to direct destiny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> You should not blame
the Gods for a lack of will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>shouting</i>]. Will! Heaven
knows I do not lack the will to rid myself
of this painted puppet, but where is
the instrument ready to my hand?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>At this moment a Shepherd of Apollonian
beauty leaps across the rail
of the balcony and bounds into the
room. Menelaus and Analytikos
start back in amazement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> An adventurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Then you have reached
the end of your story. In a moment you
will die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I have no faith in prophets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> The soldiers of the King
will give you faith. Don't you know that
it means death for any man to enter the
apartments of the Queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>looking from one to the other</i>].
Oh! So you're a couple of eunuchs.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Though nearly eighty this is too
much for Analytikos to bear. He
rushes to call the guard, but Menelaus
stops him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>to Analytikos</i>]. Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> You thank me for telling
you your doom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> No&mdash;for convincing me that
I'm where I want to be. It's taken me
a long while, but I knew I'd get here.
[<i>And then very intimately to Menelaus.</i>]
Where's the Queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Where do you come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> From the hills. I had come
down into the market-place to sell my
sheep. I had my hood filled with apples.
They were golden-red like a thousand
sunsets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>annoyed</i>]. You might skip
those bucolic details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> At the fair I met three ancient
gypsies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> What have they to do with
you coming here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You don't seem very patient.
Can't I tell my story in my own way?
They asked me for the apple I was eating
and I asked them what they'd give
for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> I'm not interested in market
quotations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You take everything so literally.
I'm sure you're easily bored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>with meaning</i>]. I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>going on cheerfully</i>]. The first
was to give me all the money she could
beg, and the second was to tell me all
the truth she could learn by listening,
and the third promised me a pretty girl.
So I chose&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He hesitates.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> You cannot escape by
spinning out your tale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Death is the end of one story
and the beginning of another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Well! Well! Come to the
point. Which did you choose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Well, you see I'd been
in the hills for a long while, so I picked
the girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> It would have been better
for you if you had chosen wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I knew you'd say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> I have spoken truly. In
a moment you will die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> It is because the old have forgotten
life that they preach wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> So you chose the girl?
Well, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> This made the other cronies
angry, and when I tossed her the apple
one of the others yelped at me: "You
may as well seek the Queen of Sparta:
she is the fairest of women." And as I
turned away I heard their laughter, but
the words had set my heart aflame and
though it cost me my life, I'll follow the
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>scandalized</i>]. Haven't
we heard enough of this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>deeply</i>]. No! I want to
hear how the story ends. It may amuse
the King.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He makes a sign to Analytikos.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> And on the ship at night I
looked long at the stars and dreamed of
possessing Helen.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Analytikos makes an involuntary
movement toward the balcony, but
Menelaus stops him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Desire has been my guiding
Mercury; the Fates are with me, and
here I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> The wrath of the King
will show you no mercy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>nonchalantly</i>]. I'm not afraid
of the King. He's fat, and&mdash;a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Shall I call the guards?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Menelaus stops him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>very significantly</i>]. So you
would give your life for a glimpse of
the Queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>swiftly</i>]. Yes! My immortal
soul, and if the fables tell the truth, the
sight will be worth the forfeit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>suddenly jumping up</i>]. It
shall be as you wish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>buoyantly</i>]. Venus has smiled
on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> In there beyond the library
you will find a room with a bath. Wait
there till I call you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Is this some trick to catch me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> A Spartan cannot lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> What will happen to you if
the King hears of this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> I will answer for the king.
Go.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Paris exits into the library.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>rubbing his hands</i>].
Shall I order the boiling oil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Oil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Now that he is being
cleaned for the sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> His torture will be greater
than being boiled alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>eagerly</i>]. You'll have
him hurled from the wall of the palace
to a forest of waiting spears below?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> None is so blind as he who
sees too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Your majesty is subtle
in his cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Haven't the years taught
you the cheapness of revenge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>mystified</i>]. You do not
intend to alter destiny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Never before has destiny
been so clear to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Then the boy must die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>with slow determination</i>].
No! He has been sent by the Gods to
save me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Your majesty!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He is trembling with apprehension.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>with unbudgeable conviction</i>].
Helena must elope with him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>falling into a seat</i>]. Ye
Gods!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. I couldn't divorce
the Queen. That would set a bad
example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Yes, very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> I couldn't desert her.
That would be beneath my honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>deeply</i>]. Was there no
other way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>pompously</i>]. The King
can do no wrong, and besides I hate the
smell of blood. Are you a prophet as
well as a scholar? Will she go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> To-night I will read the
stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>meaningfully</i>]. By to-night
I'll not need you to tell me.
[<i>Analytikos sits deep in thought.</i>]
Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Ethics cite no precedent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Do you mean to say I'm
not justified?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>cogitating</i>]. Who can
establish the punctilious ratio between
necessity and desire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>beginning to fume</i>]. This
is no time for language. Just put yourself
in my place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Being you, how can I
judge as I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>losing control</i>]. May you
choke on your dialectics! Zeus himself
could have stood it no longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Have you given her soul
a chance to grow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Her soul, indeed! It's
shut in her rouge pot. [<i>He has been
strutting about. Suddenly he sits down
crushing a roll of papyrus. He takes it
up and in utter disgust reads.</i>] "The
perfect hip, its development and permanence."
Bah! [<i>He flings it to the floor.</i>]
I've done what I had to do, and Gods
grant the bait may be sweet enough to
catch the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> If you had diverted yourself
with a war or two you might have
forgotten your troubles at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>frightened</i>]. I detest dissension
of any kind&mdash;my dream was perpetual
peace in comfortable domesticity
with a womanly woman to warm my sandals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Is not the Queen&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> No! No! The whole
world is but her mirror. And I'm expected
to face that woman every morning
at breakfast for the rest of my life,
and by Venus that's more than even a
King can bear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Even a King cannot alter
destiny. I warn you, whom the Gods
have joined together&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>in an outburst</i>]. Is for
man to break asunder!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>deeply shocked</i>]. You
talk like an atheist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> I never allow religion to
interfere with life. Go call the victim
and see that he be left alone with the
Queen.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Menelaus exits and Analytikos goes
over to the door of the library and
summons Paris, who enters clad in
a gorgeous robe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I found this in there. It looks
rather well, doesn't it? Ah! So you're
alone. I suppose that stupid friend of
yours has gone to tell the King. When
do I see the Queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> At once.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes to the door of the Queen's
apartment and claps his hand.
Tsumu enters and at the sight of
her Paris recoils the full length of

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I thought the Queen was a
blonde!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Tell Her Majesty a
stranger awaits her here.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tsumu exits, her eyes wide on
Paris.</i>]</p>

<p>You should thank the Gods for this
moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>his eyes on the door</i>]. You do
it for me. I can never remember all their
names.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Helena enters clad in her Sicily blue,

hands and head lifted to heaven he
goes into the library.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>quivering with emotion</i>]. I
have the most strange sensation of having
seen you before. Something I can't
explain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>quite practically</i>]. Please
don't bother about all sorts of fine distinctions.
Under the influence of Analytikos
and my husband, life has become a
mess of indecision. I'm a simple, direct
woman and I expect you to say just what
you think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Do you? Very well, then&mdash;[<i>He comes a step nearer to her.</i>] Fate
is impelling me toward you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes. That's much better.
So you're a fatalist. It's very Greek. I
don't see what our dramatists would do
without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> In my country there are no
dramatists. We are too busy with reality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Your people must be uncivilized
barbarians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> My people are a genuine people.
There is but one thing we worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don't tell me it's money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> It's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Analytikos says if there
weren't any money, there wouldn't be
any of those ridiculous socialists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> It isn't money. It's sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I, too, believe in sincerity.
It's the loveliest thing in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> And the most dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The truth is never dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Except when told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>making room on the couch
for him to sit next to her</i>]. You mustn't
say wicked things to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Can your theories survive a
test?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>beautifully</i>]. Truth is eternal
and survives all tests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> No. Perhaps, after all, your
soul is not ready for the supremest
heights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Do you mean to say I'm not
religious? Religion teaches the meaning
of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Has it taught you to love your
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>starting up and immediately
sitting down again</i>]. How dare you
speak to me like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You see. I was right.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes toward the balcony.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>stopping him</i>]. Whatever
made you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I've heard people talk of the
King. You could never love a man like
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>beautifully</i>]. A woman's first
duty is to love her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> There is a higher right than
duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>with conviction</i>]. Right is
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>with admiration</i>]. The world
has libeled you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Me! The Queen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You are as wise as you are
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>smiling coyly</i>]. Why, you
hardly know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I know you! I, better than all
men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i><ins class="correction" title="original reads 'rupturously'">rapturously</ins></i>]. Human law has
given you to Menelaus, but divine law
makes you mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>in amazement</i>]. What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I alone appreciate your beauty.
I alone can reach your soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You hate your husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>drawing back</i>]. Why do you
look at me like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> To see if there's one woman in
the world who dares tell the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> My husband doesn't understand
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>with conviction</i>]. I knew you
detested him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> He never listens to my aspirations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Egoist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>assuming an irresistible pose</i>].
I'm tired of being only lovely. He doesn't
realize the meaning of spiritual intercourse,
of soul communion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You dare call Moo Moo a
fool?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Has he not been too blind to
see that your soul outshines your beauty?
[<i>Then, very dramatically.</i>] You're stifling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>clearing her throat</i>]. I&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> He has made you sit upon your
wings. [<i>Helena, jumping up, shifts her
position.</i>] You are groping in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don't be silly. It's very light
in here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>undisturbed</i>]. You are stumbling,
and I have come to lead you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He steps toward her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Stop right there! [<i>Paris
stops.</i>] No man but the King can come
within ten feet of me. It's a court tradition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Necessity knows no tradition.
[<i>He falls on his knees before her.</i>] I
shall come close to you, though the flame
of your beauty consume me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You'd better be careful what
you say to me. Remember I'm the
Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> No man weighs his words who
has but a moment to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You said that exactly like an
actor. [<i>He leans very close to her.</i>]
What are you doing now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I am looking into you. You
are the clear glass in which I read the
secret of the universe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The secret of the universe.
Ah! Perhaps you could understand me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> First you must understand
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>instinctively taking up a mirror</i>].
How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> You must break with all this
prose. [<i>With an unconscious gesture he
sweeps a tray of toilet articles from the
table. Helena emits a little shriek.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The ointment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>rushing to the window and
pointing to the distance</i>]. And climb to
infinite poesie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>catching his enthusiasm, says
very blandly</i>]. There is nothing in the
world like poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>lyrically</i>]. Have you ever heard
the poignant breathing of the stars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No. I don't believe in astrology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Have you ever smelt the powdery
mists of the sun?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I should sneeze myself to
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Have you ever listened to the
sapphire soul of the sea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Has the sea a soul? But
please don't stop talking. You do it so
beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Deeds are sweeter than words.
Shall we go hand in hand to meet eternity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>not comprehending him</i>].
That's very pretty. Say it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>passionately</i>]. There's but a
moment of life left me. I shall stifle it
in ecstasy. Helena, Helena, I adore
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>jumping up in high surprise</i>].
You're not making love to me, you
naughty boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Helena.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You've spoken to me so little,
and already you dare to do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>impetuously</i>]. I am a lover of
life. I skip the inessentials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Remember who I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I have not forgotten, Daughter
of Heaven. [<i>Suddenly he leaps to his
feet.</i>] Listen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Shhh! That's the King and
Analytikos in the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> No! No! Don't you hear the
flutter of wings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Wings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>ecstatically</i>]. Venus, mother of
Love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> She has sent her messenger. I
hear the patter of little feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Those little feet are the soldiers
below in the courtyard.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A trumpet sounds.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>the truth of the situation breaking

I shall be killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Save me and save yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> I shall rescue you and lead you
on to life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No one has even spoken to
me like that before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> This is the first time your ears
have heard the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Was it of you I've been
dreaming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Your dream was but your unrealized
desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Menelaus has never made me
feel like this. [<i>And then with a sudden
shriek.</i>] Oh! I'm a wicked woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> For years I've been living
with a man I didn't love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> Yes! Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I'm lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span> [<i>at a loss</i>]. No! Yes! Yes!
No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It was a profanation of the
most holy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris.</span> The holiest awaits you, Helena!
Our love will lighten the Plutonian
realms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Menelaus never spoke to me

bear.</p>

Queen of the Trojans.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She rushes out to spread the news.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> That makes the matter
international.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>quickly</i>]. But we have
treaties with Troy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Circumstances alter treaties.
They will mean nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> No more than a scrap of
papyrus. Sparta will fight to regain her
Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> But I don't want her back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Can you tell that to
Sparta? Remember, the King can do no
wrong. Last night I dreamed of war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> No! No! Don't say that.
After the scandal I can't be expected to
fight to get her back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Sparta will see with the
eyes of chivalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>fuming</i>]. But I don't believe
in war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos</span> [<i>still obdurate</i>]. Have
you forgotten the oath pledged of old,
with Ulysses and Agamemnon? They
have sworn, if ever the time came, to
fight and defend the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. I didn't think of
the triple alliance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Can Sparta ask less of
her King?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus.</span> Let's hear the other side.
We can perhaps arbitrate. Peace at any
price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Some bargains are too
cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>hopelessly</i>]. But I am a
pacifist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> You are Menelaus of
Sparta, and Sparta's a nation of soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menelaus</span> [<i>desperately</i>]. I am too
proud to fight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analytikos.</span> Here, put on your shield.
[<i>A great clamor comes up from the courtyard,
Analytikos steps out on the balcony
and is greeted with shouts of "The
King! The King!" Addressing the

has been forced upon us. [<i>Menelaus
winces.</i>] We are a peaceful people. But
thanks to our unparalleled efficiency, the
military system of Sparta is the most
powerful in all Greece and we can mobilize
in half an hour.</p>

Never, even if it takes ten years. [<i>Menelaus

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>A very bare room in a tenement house,
uncarpeted, the boards being much worn,
and from the walls the bluish whitewash
has scaled away; in the front on one side
is a cooking-stove, and farther back on
the same side a window; on the opposite
side is a door opening into a hallway; in
the middle of the room there is a round,
worn dining-room table, on which stands
a stunted, scraggly bit of an evergreen-tree;
at the back of the room, near the
window, stands an old-fashioned safe with
perforated tin front; next it a door opening
into an inner room, and next it in
the corner a bed, on which lies a <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'palid'">pallid</ins>
woman; another woman, very old, sits in
a rocking-chair in front of the stove and
rocks. There is silence for a long space,
the old woman rocking and the woman on
the bed giving an occasional low sigh or
groan. At last the old woman speaks.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> David an' Michael
might be kapin' the Christmas wid us to-morrow
night if we hadn't left the ould
counthry. They'd never be crossin' the
sea&mdash;all the many weary miles o' wetness
an' fog an' cold to be kapin' it wid
us here in this great house o' brick walls
in a place full o' strange souls. They
would never be for crossin' all that
weary, cold, green wather, groanin' an'
tossin' like it was the grave o' sivin thousan'
divils. Ah, but it would be a black
night at sea! [<i>She remains silent for a
few minutes, staring at the stove and
rocking slowly.</i>] If they hadn't to cross
that wet, cold sea they'd maybe come.
But wouldn't they be afeard o' this great
city, an' would they iver find us here?
Six floors up, an' they niver off the
ground in their lives. What would ye be
thinkin'? [<i>The other woman does not
answer her. She then speaks petulantly.</i>]
What would ye be thinkin'?
Mary, have ye gone clane to slape?
[<i>Turns her chair and peers around the
back of it at the pallid woman on the
bed, who sighs and answers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> No, I on'y wisht I
could. Maybe they'll come&mdash;I don't
know, but father an' Michael wasn't
much for thravel. [<i>After a pause and
very wearily.</i>] Maybe they'll not come,
yet [<i>slowly</i>], maybe I'll be kapin' the
Christmas wid them there. [<i>The Old
Woman seems not to notice this, wandering
from her question back to her memories.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> No, they'll niver be
lavin' the ould land, the green land, the
home land. I'm wishing I was there wid
thim. [<i>Another pause, while she stares
at the stove.</i>] Maybe we'd have a duck
an' potatoes, an' maybe something to
drink to kape us warm against the cold.
An' the boys would all be dancin' an' the
girls have rosy cheeks. [<i>There is another
pause, and then a knock at the
door. "Come in," the two women call,
in reedy, weak voices, and a thin, slatternly
Irish woman enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> God avnin' to ye; I
came in to ask if I might borrow the loan
o' a bit o' tay, not havin' a leaf of it
left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> We have a little left,
just enough we was savin' for ourselves
to-night, but you're welcome to it&mdash;maybe
the girls will bring some. Will
ye get it for her, mother? Or she can
help herself&mdash;it's in the safe. It's on
the lower shelf among the cups an' saucers
an' plates. [<i>The Old Woman and
Neighbor go to the safe and hunt for the
tea, and do not find it readily. The safe
has little in it but a few cracked and
broken dishes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>holding up a tiny paper
bag with an ounce perhaps of tea in it.</i>]
It's just a scrap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> To be sure! We
use so much tay! We're that exthravagant!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> It hurts me to take it
from ye&mdash;maybe I'd better not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> The girls will bring
more. We always have a cupboard full
o' things. We're always able to lend to
our neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> It's in great luck, ye
are. For some of us be so poor we don't
know where the next bite's comin' from.
An' this winter whin iverything's so high
an' wages not raised, a woman can't find
enough to cook for her man's dinner.
It isn't that ye don't see things&mdash;oh,
they're in the markets an' the shops, an'
it makes yer mouth wather as ye walk
along the sthrates this day before the
Christmas to see the turkeys an' the ducks
ye'll niver ate, an' the little pigs an' the
or'nges an' bananies an' cranberries an'
the cakes an' nuts an'&mdash;it's worse, I'm
thinkin', to see thim whin there's no
money to buy than it was in the ould
counthry, where there was nothing to buy
wid the money ye didn't have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> It's all one to us poor
folk whether there be things to buy or
not. [<i>She speaks gaspingly, as one who
is short of breath.</i>] I'm on'y thinkin' o'
the clane air at home&mdash;if I could have
a mornin' o' fresh sunshine&mdash;these fogs
an' smoke choke me so. The girls would
take me out to the counthry if they had
time an' I'd get well. But they haven't
time. [<i>She falls into a fit of coughing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> But it's like to be
bright on Christmas Day. It wouldn't
iver be cloudy on Christmas Day, an'
maybe even now the stars would be crapin'
out an' the air all clear an' cold an'
the moon a-shinin' an' iverything so sthill
an' quiet an' bleamin' an' breathless
[<i>her voice falls almost to a whisper</i>],
awaitin' on the Blessed Virgin. [<i>She
goes to the window, lifts the blind, and
peers out, then throws up the sash and
leans far out. After a moment she pulls
the sash down again and the blind and
turns to those in the room with the look
of pathetic disappointment in little things,
of the aged.</i>] No, there's not a sthar, not
one little twinklin' sthar, an' how'll the
shepherds find their way? Iverything's
dull an' black an' the clouds are hangin'
down heavy an' sthill. How'll the shepherds
find their way without the sthar
to guide thim? [<i>Then almost whimpering.</i>]
An' David an' Michael will niver
be crossin' that wet, black sea! An' the
girls&mdash;how'll they find their way home?
They'll be lost somewhere along by the
hedges. Ohone, ohone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> Now, grannie, what
would ye be sayin'? There's niver a
hedge anywhere but granite blocks an'
electric light poles an' plenty o' light in
the city for thim to see all their way
home. [<i>Then to the woman.</i>] Ain't
they late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> They're always late, an'
they kape gettin' lather an' lather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> Yis, av coorse, the
sthores is all open in the avnin's before
Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> They go so early in the
mornin' an' get home so late at night, an'
they're so tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>whiningly</i>]. They're
lucky to be young enough to work an'
not be married. I've got to go home
to the childer an' give thim their tay.
Pat's gone to the saloon again, an' to-morrow
bein' Christmas I misdoubt he'll
be terrible dhrunk again, an' me on'y
jist well from the blow in the shoulder
the last time. [<i>She wipes her eyes and
moves towards the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Sthay an' kape
Christmas wid us. We're goin' to have
our celebratin' to-night on Christmas Eve,
the way folks do here. I like it best on
Christmas Day, the way 'tis in the ould
counthry, but here 'tis Christmas Eve
they kape. We're waitin' for the girls to
come home to start things&mdash;they knowin'
how&mdash;Mary an' me on'y know how
to kape Christmas Day as 'tis at home.
But the girls'll soon be here, an' they'll
have the three an' do the cookin' an' all,
an' we'll kape up the jollity way into the
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>looks questioningly
and surprised at the Woman, whose eyes
are on the mother.</i>] Nay, if Pat came
home dhrunk an' didn't find me, he'd kill
me. We have all to be movin' on to our
own throubles. [<i>She goes out, and the
old woman leaves the Christmas-tree
which she has been fingering and admiring,
and sits down in the rocking-chair
again. After a while she croons to herself
in a high, broken voice. This lasts
some time, when there is the noise of a
slamming door and then of footsteps approaching.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> If I could on'y be in
the counthry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Maybe that would
be the girls! [<i>She starts tremblingly to
her feet, but the steps come up to the
door and go by.</i>] If David and Michael
was to come now an' go by&mdash;there bein'
no sthar to guide thim!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Nay, mother, 'twas the
shepherds that was guided by the sthar
an' to the bed o' the Blessed Babe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Aye, so 'twas.
What be I thinkin' of? The little Blessed
Babe! [<i>She smiles and sits staring at
the stove again for a little.</i>] But they
could not find Him to-night. 'Tis so
dark an' no sthars shinin.' [<i>After another
pause.</i>] An' what would shepherds
do in a ghreat city? 'Twould be
lost they'd be, quicker than in any bog.
Think ye, Mary, that the boys would be
hootin' thim an' the p'lice, maybe, would
want to be aristin' thim for loitherin'.
They'd niver find the Blessed Babe, an'
they'd have to be movin' on. [<i>Another
pause, and then there is the sound of approaching
footsteps again. The Old
Woman grasps the arms of her chair and
leans forward, intently listening.</i>]&mdash;That
would sure be the girls this time! [<i>But
again the footsteps go by. The Old
Woman sighs.</i>] Ah, but 'tis weary
waitin'! [<i>There is another long pause.</i>]
'Twas on that day that David an' me
was plighted&mdash;a brave Christmas Day
wid a shinin' sun an' a sky o' blue wid
fair, white clouds. An' David an' me
met at the early mass in the dark o' the
frosty mornin' afore the sun rose&mdash;an'
there was all day good times an' a duck
for dinner and puddin's an' a party at the
O'Brady's in the evenin', whin David an'
me danced. Ah, but he was a beautiful
dancer, an' me, too&mdash;I was as light on
my feet as a fairy. [<i>She begins to croon
an old dance tune and hobbles to her
feet, and, keeping time with her head,
tries a grotesque and feeble sort of dancing.
Her eyes brighten and she smiles
proudly.</i>] Aye, but I danced like a
fairy, an' there was not another couple
so sprightly an' handsome in all the
country. [<i>She tires, and, looking pitiful
and disappointed, hobbles back to
her chair, and drops into it again.</i>] Ah,
but I be old now, and the strength fails
me. [<i>She falls into silence for a few
minutes.</i>] 'Twas the day before <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'the the'">the</ins>
little man, the little white dove, my
next Christmas that Michael was born&mdash;little
son! [<i>There is a moment's pause,
and then the pallid woman on the bed
has a violent fit of coughing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Mother, could ye get
me a cup o' wather? If the girls was
here to get me a bite to ate, maybe it
would kape the breath in me the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman</span> [<i>starts and stares at

the present reality. She gets up
and goes over to the window under which
there is a pail full of water. She dips
some out in a tin cup and carries it to
her bed.</i>] Ye should thry to get up an'
move about some, so ye can enjoy the
Christmas threat. 'Tis bad bein' sick on
Christmas. Thry, now, Mary, to sit up
a bit. The girls'll be wantin' ye to be
merry wid the rest av us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> [<i>looking at her mother
with a sad wistfulness</i>]. I wouldn't spoil
things for the girls if I could help.
Maybe, mother, if ye'd lift me a little I
could sit up. [<i>The Old Woman tugs at
her, and she herself tries hard to get
into a sitting posture, but after some
effort and panting for breath, she falls
back again. After a pause for rest, she
speaks gaspingly.</i>] Maybe I'll feel
sthronger lather whin the girls come
home&mdash;they could help me&mdash;[<i>with the
plaint of longing in her voice</i>] they be so
late! [<i>After another pause.</i>] Maybe I'll
be sthrong again in the mornin'&mdash;if I'd
had a cup of coffee.&mdash;Maybe I could get
up&mdash;an' walk about&mdash;an' do the cookin'.
[<i>There is a knock at the door, and
again they call, "Come in," in reedy,
weak voices. There enters a little messenger
boy in a ragged overcoat that
reaches almost to his heels. His eyes
are large and bright, his face pale
and dirty, and he is fearfully tired and
worn.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Why, Tim, boy, come
in. Sit ye down an' rest, ye're lookin'
weary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Come to the stove,
Timmie, man, an' warm yourself. We
always kape a warm room an' a bright
fire for visitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> I was awful cold an' hungry
an' I come home to get somethin' to
eat before. I started out on another
trip, but my sisters ain't home from the
store yit, an' the fire's gone out in the
stove, an' the room's cold as outside. I
thought maybe ye'd let me come in here
an' git warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Poor orphan! Poor
lamb! To be shure ye shall get warm by
our sthove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> The cars are so beastly col'
an' so crowded a feller mostly has to
stand on the back platform. [<i>The Old
Woman takes him by the shoulder and
pushes him toward the stove, but he resists.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> No, thank ye&mdash;I don't
want to go so near yet; my feet's all
numb an' they allays hurt so when they
warms up fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Thin sit ye down
off from the sthove. [<i>Moves the rocking-chair
farther away from the stove for
him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> If ye don't mind I'd rather
stand on 'em 'til they gets a little used
to it. They been numb off an' on mos'
all day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Soon as yer sisters
come, Timmie, ye'd betther go to bed&mdash;'tis
the best place to get warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> I can't&mdash;I got most a
three-hour trip yet. I won't get home
any 'fore midnight if I don't get lost,
and maybe I'll get lost&mdash;I did once out
there. I've got to take a box o' 'Merican
Beauty roses to a place eight mile out,
an' the house ain't on the car track, but
nearly a mile off, the boss said. I wisht
they could wait till mornin', but the orders
was they just got to get the roses
to-night. You see, out there they don'
have no gas goin' nights when there's a
moon, an' there'd ought to be a moon
to-night, on'y the clouds is so thick there
ain't no light gets through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> There's no sthar
shinin' to-night, Tim. [<i>She shakes her
head ominously. She goes to the window
for the second time, opens it as before,
and looks out. Shutting the window,
she comes back and speaks slowly
and sadly.</i>] Niver a sthar. An' the
shepherds will be havin' a hard time,
Tim, like you, findin' their way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> Shepherds? In town?
What shepherds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> She means the shepherds
on Christmas Eve that wint to find
the Blessed Babe, Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> 'Tis Christmas
Eve, Timmie; ye haven't forgot that, have
ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> You bet I ain't. I know
pretty well when Christmas is comin', by
the way I got to hustle, an' the size of the
boxes I got to carry. Seems as if my
legs an' me would like to break up pardnership.
I got to work till midnight
every night, an' I'm so sleepy I drop off
in the cars whenever I get a seat. An'
the girls is at the store so early an' late
they don't get time to cook me nothin'
to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Be ye hungry, Timmie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy</span> [<i>diffidently and looking at the
floor</i>]. No, I ain't hungry now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Be ye shure, Timmie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> Oh, I kin go till I git home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Mother, can't you find
something for him to eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> To be shure, to be
shure. [<i>Bustling about.</i>] We always
kapes a full cupboard to thrate our
neighbors wid whin they comes in.
[<i>She goes to the empty safe and fusses
in it to find something. She pretends to
be very busy, and then glances around
at the boy with a sly look and a smile.</i>]
Ah, Timmie, lad, what would ye like to
be havin', now? If you had the wish o'
yer heart for yer Christmas dinner an'
a good fairy to set it all afore ye?
Ye'd be wishin' maybe, for a fine roast
duck, to begin wid, in its own gravies an'
some apple sauce to go wid it; an' ye'd
be thinkin' o' a little bit o' pig nicely
browned an' a plate of potaties; an' the
little fairy woman would be bringin' yer
puddin's an' nuts an' apples an' a dish o'
the swatest tay. [<i>The Boy smiles rather
ruefully.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> But, mother, you're not
gettin' Tim something to ate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> She's makin' me mouth
water all right. [<i>The Old Woman goes
back to her search, but again turns about
with a cunning look, and says to the
boy:</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Maybe ye'll meet
that little fairy woman out there in the
counthry road where ye're takin' the
roses! [<i>Nods her head knowingly, turning
to the safe again.</i>] Here's salt an'
here's pepper an' here's mustard an' a
crock full o' sugar, an', oh! Tim, here's
some fine cold bacon&mdash;fine, fat, cold
bacon&mdash;an' here's half a loaf o' white
wheat bread! Why, Timmie, lad, that's
just the food to make boys fat! Ye'll
grow famously on it. 'Tis a supper,
whin ye add to it a dhrop o' iligant milk,
that's fit for a king. [<i>She bustles about
with great show of being busy and having
much to prepare. Puts the plate of
cold bacon upon the table where stands
the stunted bit of an evergreen-tree, then
brings the half-loaf of bread and cuts it
into slices, laying pieces of bacon on the
slices of bread. Then she pours out a
glass of milk from a dilapidated and
broken pitcher in the safe and brings it
to the table, the Boy all the while watching
her hungrily. At last he says rather
apologetically to the woman.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> I ain't had nothin' since a
wienerwurst at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Now, dhraw up,
Timmie, boy, an' ate yer fill; ye're more
thin welcome. [<i>The boy does not sit
down, but stands by the table and eats
a slice of bread and bacon, drinking from
the glass of milk occasionally.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Don't they niver give
ye nothin' to ate at the gran' houses
when ye'd be takin' the roses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> Not them. They'd as soon
think o' feedin' a telephone or an automobile
as me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> But don't they ask ye
in to get warm whin ye've maybe come
so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy.</span> No, they don't seem to look
at me 'zacly like a caller. They generally
steps out long enough to sign the
receipt-book an' shut the front door behin'
'em so as not to let the house get
col' the length o' time I'm standin' there.
Well, I'm awful much obleeged to ye.
Now, I got to be movin' on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Sthop an' cilibrate
the Christmas wid us. We ain't started
to do nothin' yet because the girls
haven't come&mdash;they know how [<i>nodding
her head</i>]&mdash;an' they're goin' to bring
things&mdash;all kinds o' good things to ate
an' a branch of rowan berries&mdash;ah, boy,
a great branch o' rowan wid scarlet berries
shinin' [<i>gesticulating and with gleaming
eyes</i>], an' we'll all be merry an' kape
it up late into the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy</span> [<i>in a little fear of her</i>]. I
guess it's pretty late now. I got to make
that trip an' I guess when I get home
I'll be so sleepy I'll jus' tumble in.
Ye've been awful good to me, an' it's
the first time I been warm to-day.
Good-by. [<i>He starts toward the door,
but the Old Woman follows him and
speaks to him coaxingly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Ah, don't ye go,
Michael, lad! Now, bide wid us a bit.
[<i>The Boy, surprised at the name, looks
queerly at the Old Woman, who then
stretches out her arms to him, and says
beseechingly:</i>] Ah, boy, ah, Mike, bide
wid us, now ye've come! We've been
that lonesome widout ye!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy</span> [<i>frightened and shaking his
head</i>]. I've got to be movin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> No, Michael, little
lamb, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Boy</span> [<i>almost terrified, watching
her with staring eyes, and backing out</i>].
I got to go! [<i>The Boy goes out, and
the Old Woman breaks into weeping,
totters over to her old rocking-chair and
drops into it, rocks to and fro, wailing
to herself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Oh, to have him
come an' go again, my little Michael, my
own little lad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Don't ye, dearie; now,
then, don't ye! 'Twas not Michael, but
just our little neighbor boy, Tim. Ye
know, poor lamb, now if ye'll thry to
remember, that father an' Michael is
gone to the betther land an' us is left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Nay, nay, 'tis the
fairies that took thim an' have thim now,
kapin' thim an' will not ever give thim
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Whisht, mother! Spake
not of the little folk on the Holy
Night! [<i>Crosses herself.</i>] Have ye forgot
the time o' all the year it is? Now,
dhry yer eyes, dearie, an' thry to be
cheerful like 'fore the girls be comin'
home. [<i>A noise is heard, the banging of
a door and footsteps.</i>] Thim be the girls
now, shure they be comin' at last. [<i>But
the sound of footsteps dies away.</i>] But
they'll be comin' soon. [<i>Wearily, but
with the inveterate hope.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The two women relapse into silence
again, which is undisturbed for a
few minutes. Then there is a
knock at the door, and together
in quavering, reedy voices, they
call, "Come in," as before. There
enters a tall, big, broad-shouldered
woman with a cold, discontented,
hard look upon the face that might
have been handsome some years
back; still, in her eyes, as she
looks at the pallid woman on the
bed, there is something that denotes
a softness underneath it all.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Good avnin' to ye!
We're that pleased to see our neighbors!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>without paying any attention
to the Old Woman, but entirely
addressing the woman on the bed.</i>]
How's yer cough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Oh, it's jist the same&mdash;maybe
a little betther. If I could on'y
get to the counthry! But the girls must
be workin'&mdash;they haven't time to take
me. Sit down, won't ye? [<i>The Neighbor
goes to the bed and sits down on
the foot of it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> I'm most dead, I'm
so tired. I did two washin's to-day&mdash;went
out and did one this mornin' and
then my own after I come home this
afternoon. I jus' got through sprinklin'
it an' I'll iron to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Not on Christmas Day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>with a sneer</i>]. Christmas
Day! Did ye hear 'bout the Beckers?
Well, they was all put out on the
sidewalk this afternoon. Becker's been
sick, ye know, an' ain't paid his rent an'
his wife's got a two weeks' old baby.
It sort o' stunned Mis' Becker, an' she
sat on one of the mattresses out there
an' wouldn't move, an' nobody couldn't
do nothin' with her. But they ain't the
only ones has bad luck&mdash;Smith, the
painter, fell off a ladder an' got killed.
They took him to the hospital, but it
wasn't no use&mdash;his head was all mashed
in. His wife's got them five boys an'
Smith never saved a cent, though he
warn't a drinkin' man. It's a good thing
Smith's children is boys&mdash;they can make
their livin' easier!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> [<i>smiling faintly</i>]. Ain't
ye got no cheerful news to tell? It's
Christmas Eve, ye know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> Christmas Eve don't
seem to prevent people from dyin' an'
bein' turned out o' house an' home. Did
ye hear how bad the dipthery is? They
say as how if it gits much worse they'll
have to close the school in our ward.
Two o' the Homan children's dead with
it. The first one wasn't sick but two
days, an' they say his face all turned
black 'fore he died. But it's a good
thing they're gone, for the Homans
ain't got enough to feed the other six.
Did ye hear 'bout Jim Kelly drinkin'
again? Swore off for two months, an'
then took to it harder'n ever&mdash;perty
near killed the baby one night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> [<i>with a wan, beseeching
smile</i>]. Won't you please not tell me
any more? It just breaks me heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>grimly</i>]. I ain't got
no other kind o' news to tell. I s'pose I
might's well go home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> No, don't ye go. I
like to have ye here when ye're kinder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>fingering the bed
clothes and smoothing them over the
woman</i>]. Well, it's gettin' late, an' I
guess ye ought to go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Oh, no, I won't go to
slape till the girls come. They'll bring
me somethin' to give me strength. If
they'd on'y come soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> Ye ain't goin' to set
up 'til they git home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> That we are.
We're kapin' the cilebratin' till they
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> What celebratin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Why, the Christmas,
to be shure. We're goin' to have
high jinks to-night. In the ould counthry
'tis always Christmas Day, but here
'tis begun on Christmas Eve, an' we're
on'y waitin' for the girls, because they
know how to fix things betther nor Mary
an' me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>staring</i>]. But ain't
they workin' in the store?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Yes, but they're
comin' home early to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor</span> [<i>laughing ironically</i>].
Don't ye fool yerselves. Why, they've
got to work harder to-night than any in
the whole year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> [<i>wistfully</i>]. But they
did say they'd thry to come home early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The  Neighbor.</span> The store's all
crowded to-night. Folks 'at's got money
to spend never remembers it till the last
minute. If they didn't have none they'd
be thinkin' 'bout it long ahead. Well,
I got to be movin'. I wouldn't stay
awake, if I was you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Sthay and kape the
Christmas wid us! We'll be havin' high
jinks by an' by. Sthay, now, an' help
us wid our jollity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Neighbor.</span> Nay, I left my children
in bed, an' I got to go back to 'em.
An' I got to get some rest myself&mdash;I
got that ironin' ahead o' me in the mornin'.
You folks better get yer own rest.

Yis, we're goin' to have a gran'

dark an' foul, but they've got the little
folk to guide thim! An' whin they
reach the city&mdash;the poor, lonesome shepherds
from the hills!&mdash;they'll find
naught but coldness an' hardness an'
hurry. [<i>Questioningly.</i>] Will the fairies
show thim the way? Fairies' eyes
be used to darkness, but can they see
where it is black night in one corner an'
a blaze o' light in another? [<i>She goes
to the window for the third time, opens it
and leans far out for a long time, then
turns about and goes on in her monotone,
closing the window.&mdash;She seems by
this time quite to have forgotten the
presence of the pallid woman on the bed,
who has closed her eyes, and lies like
one dead.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Old Woman.</span> Nay, there's niver
a sthar, an' the clouds are hangin' heavier
an' lower an' the flakes o' snow are
fallin'. Poor little folk guidin' thim poor
lost shepherds, leadin' thim by the hand
so gently because there's no others to be
kind to thim, an' bringin' thim to the
manger o' the Blessed Babe. [<i>She comes
over to her rocking-chair and again sits
down in it, rocks slowly to and fro,
nodding her head in time to the motion.</i>]
Poor little mite of a babe, so cold an'
unwelcome an' forgotten save by the silly
ould shepherds from the hills! The silly
ould shepherds from the strength o' the
hills, who are comin' through the darkness
in the lead o' the little folk! [<i>She

sick woman upon the bed dies, the
Old Woman being asleep does not
notice the slight struggle with
death. The fire has gone out in

darkness when the two girls come
stumbling in. They are too tired
to speak, too weary to show surprise
that the occupants of the
room are not awake. They fumble
about, trying to find matches
in the darkness, and finally discover
them and a candle in the
safe. They light the candle and
place it upon the table by the
scraggy little evergreen-tree.
They turn about and discern their
grandmother asleep in the rocking-chair.
Hurriedly they turn to
the bed and discover their mother
lying there dead. For a full minute
they stand gazing at her, the
surprise, wonder, awe, misery increasing
in their faces; then with
screams they run to the bed, throw
themselves on their knees and bury
their faces, sobbing, in the bedclothes
at the Woman's feet.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>Captain Keeney's cabin on
board the steam whaling ship Atlantic
Queen&mdash;a small, square compartment
about eight feet high with a skylight in
the center looking out on the poop deck.
On the left (the stern of the ship) a long
bench with rough cushions is built in
against the wall. In front of the bench
a table. Over the bench, several curtained
port-holes.</i></p>

<p><i>In the rear left, a door leading to the
captain's sleeping quarters. To the right
of the door a small organ, looking as if
it were brand new, is placed against the
wall.</i></p>

<p><i>On the right, to the rear, a marble-topped
sideboard. On the sideboard, a
woman's sewing basket. Farther forward,
a doorway leading to the companion-way,
and past the officers' quarters to
the main deck.</i></p>

<p><i>In the center of the room, a stove.
From the middle of the ceiling a hanging
lamp is suspended. The walls of the
cabin are painted white.</i></p>

<p><i>There is no rolling of the ship, and the
light which comes through the sky-light
is sickly and faint, indicating one of those
gray days of calm when ocean and sky
are alike dead. The silence is unbroken
except for the measured tread of some
one walking up and down on the poop
deck overhead.</i></p>

<p><i>It is nearing two bells&mdash;one o'clock&mdash;in
the afternoon of a day in the year
1895.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>At the rise of the curtain there is a
moment of intense silence. Then The
Steward enters and commences to clear
the table of the few dishes which still remain
on it after the Captain's dinner.
He is an old, grizzled man dressed in
dungaree pants, a sweater, and a woolen
cap with ear flaps. His manner is sullen
and angry. He stops stacking up the
plates and casts a quick glance upward
at the skylight; then tiptoes over to the
closed door in rear and listens with his
ear pressed to the crack. What he hears
makes his face darken and he mutters a
furious curse. There is a noise from the
doorway on the right and he darts back
to the table.</i></p>

<p><i>Ben enters. He is an over-grown
gawky boy with a long, pinched face.
He is dressed in sweater, fur cap, etc.
His teeth are chattering with the cold
and he hurries to the stove where he
stands for a moment shivering, blowing on
his hands, slapping them against his sides,
on the verge of crying.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>in relieved tones&mdash;seeing
who it is</i>]. Oh, 'tis you, is it? What're
ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove
where ye belong and ye'll find no need
of chatterin'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben.</span> It's c-c-cold. [<i>Trying to control
his chattering teeth&mdash;derisively.</i>]
Who d'ye think it were&mdash;the Old Man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>makes a threatening
move&mdash;Ben shrinks away</i>]. None o'
your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye.
[<i>More kindly.</i>] Where was it ye've been
all o' the time&mdash;the fo'c's'tle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> Let the Old Man see ye
up for'ard monkeyshinin' with the hands
and ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in
a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben.</span> Aw, he don't see nothin'. [<i>A
trace of awe in his tones&mdash;he glances
upward.</i>] He jest walks up and down
like he didn't notice nobody&mdash;and stares
at the ice to the no'the'ard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>the same tone of awe
creeping into his voice</i>]. He's always
starin' at the ice. [<i>In a sudden rage,
shaking his fist at the skylight.</i>] Ice, ice,
ice! Damn him and damn the ice!
Holdin' us in for nigh on a year&mdash;nothin'
to see but ice&mdash;stuck in it like a
fly in molasses!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>apprehensively</i>]. Ssshh! He'll
hear ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>raging</i>]. Aye, damn,
and damn the Arctic seas, and damn this
rotten whalin' ship of his, and damn me
for a fool to ever ship on it! [<i>Subsiding
as if realizing the uselessness of this outburst&mdash;shaking
his head&mdash;slowly, with
deep conviction.</i>] He's a hard man&mdash;as
hard a man as ever sailed the seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>solemnly</i>]. Aye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> The two years we all
signed up for are done this day! Two
years o' this dog's life, and no luck in
the fishin', and the hands half starved
with the food runnin' low, rotten as it is;
and not a sign of him turnin' back for
home! [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Home! I begin to
doubt if ever I'll set foot on land again.
[<i>Excitedly.</i>] What is it he thinks he's
goin' to do? Keep us all up here after
our time is worked out till the last man
of us is starved to death or frozen?
We've grub enough hardly to last out the
voyage back if we started now. What
are the men goin' to do 'bout it? Did
ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'tle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>going over to him&mdash;in a half
whisper</i>]. They said if he don't put back
south for home to-day they're goin' to
mutiny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>with grim satisfaction</i>].
Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only thing they
can do; and serve him right after the
manner he's treated them&mdash;'s if they
weren't no better nor dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben.</span> The ice is all broke up to
s'uth'ard. They's clear water s'far 's you
can see. He ain't got no excuse for not
turnin' back for home, the men says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. He won't
look nowheres but no'the'ard where
they's only the ice to see. He don't want
to see no clear water. All he thinks on
is gettin' the ile&mdash;'s if it was our fault
he ain't had good luck with the whales.
[<i>Shaking his head.</i>] I think the man's
mighty nigh losin' his senses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>awed</i>]. D'you really think he's
crazy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> Aye, it's the punishment
o' God on him. Did ye ever hear
of a man who wasn't crazy do the things
he does? [<i>Pointing to the door in rear.</i>]
Who but a man that's mad would take
his woman&mdash;and as sweet a woman as
ever was&mdash;on a rotten whalin' ship to
the Arctic seas to be locked in by the ice
for nigh on a year, and maybe lose her
senses forever&mdash;for it's sure she'll never
be the same again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>sadly</i>]. She useter be awful nice
to me before&mdash;[<i>His eyes grow wide and
frightened.</i>] she got&mdash;like she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> Aye, she was good to
all of us. 'Twould have been hell on
board without her; for he's a hard man&mdash;a
hard, hard man&mdash;a driver if there ever
was one. [<i>With a grim laugh.</i>] I hope
he's satisfied now&mdash;drivin' her on till
she's near lost her mind. And who could
blame her? 'Tis a God's wonder we're
not a ship full of crazed people&mdash;with
the ice all the time, and the quiet so thick
you're afraid to hear your own voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>with a frightened glance toward
the door on right</i>]. She don't never speak
to me no more&mdash;jest looks at me 's if
she didn't know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> She don't know no one&mdash;but
him. She talks to him&mdash;when
she does talk&mdash;right enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben.</span> She does nothin' all day long
now but sit and sew&mdash;and then she cries
to herself without makin' no noise. I've
seen her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward.</span> Aye, I could hear her
through the door a while back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ben</span> [<i>tiptoes over to the door and listens</i>].
She's cryin' now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>furiously&mdash;shaking his
fist</i>]. God send his soul to hell for the
devil he is!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is the noise of some one coming
slowly down the companion-way
stairs. The Steward hurries
to his stacked-up dishes. He is so
nervous from fright that he knocks
off the top one which falls and
breaks on the floor. He stands
aghast, trembling with dread. Ben
is violently rubbing off the organ
with a piece of cloth which he has
snatched from his pocket. Captain
Keeney appears in the doorway
on right and comes into the
cabin, removing his fur cap as he
does so. He is a man of about
forty, around five-ten in height but
looking much shorter on account
of the enormous proportions of his
shoulders and chest. His face is
massive and deeply lined, with
gray-blue eyes of a bleak hardness,
and a tightly-clenched, thin-lipped
mouth. His thick hair is long and
gray. He is dressed in a heavy
blue jacket and blue pants stuffed
into his sea-boots. He is followed
into the cabin by the Second Mate,
a rangy six-footer with a lean
weather-beaten face. The Mate is
dressed about the same as the captain.
He is a man of thirty or so.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>comes toward The Steward
with a stern look on his face. The Steward
is visibly frightened and the stack of
dishes rattles in his trembling hands.
Keeney draws back his fist and The Steward
shrinks away. The fist is gradually
lowered and Keeney speaks slowly</i>].
'Twould be like hitting a worm. It is
nigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this
truck not cleared yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>stammering</i>]. Y-y-yes,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Instead of doin' your rightful
work ye've been below here gossipin'
old women's talk with that boy. [<i>To
Ben, fiercely.</i>] Get out o' this you!
Clean up the chart room. [<i>Ben darts
past the Mate to the open doorway.</i>]
Pick up that dish, Mr. Steward!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>doing so with difficulty</i>].
Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> The next dish you break, Mr.
Steward, you take a bath in the Behring
Sea at the end of a rope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Steward</span> [<i>trembling</i>]. Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He hurries out. The Second Mate
walks slowly over to the Captain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> I warn't 'specially anxious the
man at the wheel should catch what I
wanted to say to you, sir. That's why
I asked you to come below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. Speak your
say, Mr. Slocum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>unconsciously lowering his
voice</i>]. I'm afeared there'll be trouble
with the hands by the look o' things.
They'll likely turn ugly, every blessed
one o' them, if you don't put back. The
two years they signed up for is up to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> And d'you think you're tellin'
me something new, Mr. Slocum? I've
felt it in the air this long time past.
D'you think I've not seen their ugly looks
and the grudgin' way they worked?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The door in rear is opened and Mrs.
Keeney stands in the doorway.
She is a slight, sweet-faced little
woman, primly dressed in black.
Her eyes are red from weeping
and her face drawn and pale. She
takes in the cabin with a frightened
glance and stands as if fixed to the
spot by some nameless dread,
clasping and unclasping her hands
nervously. The two men turn and
look at her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>with rough tenderness</i>]. Well,
Annie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>as if awakening from a
dream</i>]. David, I&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She is silent. The Mate starts for
the doorway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>turning to him&mdash;sharply</i>].
Wait!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> D'you want anything, Annie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>after a pause during
which she seems to be endeavoring to
collect her thoughts</i>]. I thought maybe&mdash;I'd
go up on deck, David, to get a
breath of fresh air.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stands humbly awaiting his permission.
He and The Mate exchange
a significant glance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> It's too cold, Annie. You'd
best stay below. There's nothing to look
at on deck&mdash;but ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>monotonously</i>]. I know&mdash;ice,
ice, ice! But there's nothing to see
down here but these walls.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She makes a gesture of loathing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> You can play the organ, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>dully</i>]. I hate the
organ. It puts me in mind of home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>a touch of resentment in his
voice</i>]. I got it jest for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>dully</i>]. I know. [<i>She
turns away from them and walks slowly
to the bench on left. She lifts up one of
the curtains and looks through a <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'port-hale'">porthole</ins>;
then utters an exclamation of joy.</i>]
Ah, water! Clear water! As far as I
can see! How good it looks after all
these months of ice! [<i>She turns round to
them, her face transfigured with joy.</i>]
Ah, now I must go up on deck and look
at it, David!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>frowning</i>]. Best not to-day,
Annie. Best wait for a day when the
sun shines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>desperately</i>]. But the
sun never shines in this terrible place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>a tone of command in his
voice</i>]. Best not to-day, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>crumbling before this
command&mdash;abjectly</i>]. Very well, David.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stands there, staring straight
before her as if in a daze.&mdash;The
two men look at her uneasily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Annie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>dully</i>]. Yes, David.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Me and Mr. Slocum has business
to talk about&mdash;ship's business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney.</span> Very well, David.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes slowly out, rear, and
leaves the door three-quarters shut
behind her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Best not have her on deck if
they's goin' to be any trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> And trouble they's going to
be. I feel it in my bones. [<i>Takes a revolver
from the pocket of his coat and
examines it.</i>] Got your'n?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Not that we'll have to use
'em&mdash;not if I know their breed of dog&mdash;jest
to frighten 'em up a bit. [<i>Grimly.</i>]
I ain't never been forced to use one yit;
and trouble I've had by land and by
sea s'long as I kin remember, and will
have till my dyin' day, I reckon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>hesitatingly</i>]. Then you ain't
goin'&mdash;to turn back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Turn back! Mr. Slocum,
did you ever hear o' me pointin' s'uth for
home with only a measly four hundred
barrel of ile in the hold?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>hastily</i>]. But the grub's gittin'
low.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> They's enough to last a long
time yit, if they're careful with it; and
they's plenty of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> They say it's not fit to eat&mdash;what's
left; and the two years they signed
on fur is up to-day. They might make
trouble for you in the courts when we git
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Let them make what law
trouble they kin! I don't give a damn
'bout the money. I've got to git the ile!
[<i>Glancing sharply at the Mate.</i>] You
ain't turnin' no sea lawyer, be you, Mr.
Slocum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>flushing</i>]. Not by a hell of a
sight, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> What do the fools want to
go home fur now? Their share o' the
four hundred barrel wouldn't keep them
in chewin' terbacco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. They wants to git back
to their old folks an' things, I s'pose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>looking at him searchingly</i>].
'N you want to turn back too. [<i>The
Mate looks down confusedly before his
sharp gaze.</i>] Don't lie, Mr. Slocum.
It's writ down plain in your eyes. [<i>With
grim sarcasm.</i>] I hope, Mr. Slocum, you
ain't agoin' to jine the men agin me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. That ain't fair,
sir, to say sich things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>with satisfaction</i>]. I warn't
much afeard o' that, Tom. You been with
me nigh on ten year and I've learned ye
whalin'. No man kin say I ain't a good
master, if I be a hard one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> I warn't thinkin' of myself, sir&mdash;'bout
turnin' home, I mean. [<i>Desperately.</i>]
But Mrs. Keeney, sir&mdash;seems
like she ain't jest satisfied up here, ailin'
like&mdash;what with the cold an' bad luck
an' the ice an' all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>his face clouding&mdash;rebukingly,
but not severely</i>]. That's my business,
Mr. Slocum. I'll thank you to steer
a clear course o' that. [<i>A pause.</i>] The
ice'll break up soon to no'the'ard. I
could see it startin' to-day. And when
it goes and we git some sun Annie'll pick
up. [<i>Another pause&mdash;then he bursts
forth.</i>] It ain't the damned money
what's keepin' me up in the Northern
seas, Tom. But I can't go back to Homeport
with a measly four hundred barrel
of ile. I'd die fust. I ain't never come
back home in all my days without a full
ship. Ain't that true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir; but this voyage you
been ice-bound, an'&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. And d'you
s'pose any of 'em would believe that&mdash;any
o' them skippers I've beaten voyage
after voyage? Can't you hear 'em
laughin' and sneerin'&mdash;Tibbots n' Harris
n' Simms and the rest&mdash;and all o' Homeport
makin' fun o' me? "Dave Keeney,
what boasts he's the best whalin' skipper
out o' Homeport, comin' back with a
measly four hundred barrel of ile!"
[<i>The thought of this drives him into a
frenzy and he smashes his fist down on
the marble top of the sideboard.</i>] I got
to git the ile, I tell you! How could I
figger on this ice? It's never been so
bad before in the thirty year I been
acomin' here. And now it's breakin' up.
In a couple o' days it'll be all gone. And
they's whale here, plenty of 'em. I know
they is and I ain't never gone wrong yit.
I got to git the ile! I got to git it in
spite of all hell, and by God, I ain't agoin'
home till I do git it!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is the sound of subdued sobbing
from the door in rear. The
two men stand silent for a moment,
listening. Then Keeney goes over
to the door and looks in. He hesitates
for a moment as if he were
going to enter&mdash;then closes the
door softly. Joe, the harpooner, an
enormous six-footer with a battered,
ugly face, enters from right
and stands waiting for the Captain
to notice him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>turning and seeing him</i>].
Don't be standin' there like a hawk, Harpooner.
Speak up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>confusedly</i>]. We want&mdash;the
men, sir&mdash;they wants to send a depitation
aft to have a word with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>furiously</i>]. Tell 'em to go to&mdash;[<i>Checks
himself and continues grimly.</i>]
Tell 'em to come. I'll see 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> Aye, aye, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>with a grim smile</i>]. Here it
comes, the trouble you spoke of, Mr.
Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it.
It's better to crush such things at the
start than let them make headway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>worriedly</i>]. Shall I wake up
the First and Fourth, sir? We might
need their help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> No, let them sleep. I'm well
able to handle this alone, Mr. Slocum.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There is the shuffling of footsteps
from outside and five of the crew
crowd into the cabin, led by Joe.
All are dressed alike&mdash;sweaters,
sea boots, etc. They glance uneasily
at the Captain, twirling their
fur caps in their hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Well? Who's
to speak fur ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>stepping forward with an air of
bravado</i>]. I be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>eyeing him up and down
coldly</i>]. So you be. Then speak your
say and be quick about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>trying not to wilt before the Captain's
glance and avoiding his eyes</i>]. The
time we signed up for is done to-day.</p>

nothin' I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> You ain't p'intin' fur home yit,

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> No, and I ain't agoin' to till

the others mumble angrily to one another</i>].

puts back for home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>fiercely</i>]. You ain't, ain't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe.</span> No; and the law courts'll say we
was right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> To hell with your law courts!
We're at sea now and I'm the law on
this ship! [<i>Edging up toward the harpooner.</i>]
And every mother's son of you
what don't obey orders goes in irons.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>There are more angry exclamations
from the crew. Mrs. Keeney appears
in the doorway in rear and
looks on with startled eyes. None
of the men notice her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe</span> [<i>with bravado</i>]. Then we're agoin'
to mutiny and take the old hooker home
ourselves. Ain't we, boys?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>As he turns his head to look at the
others, Keeney's fist shoots out to
the side of his jaw. Joe goes down
in a heap and lies there. Mrs.
Keeney gives a shriek and hides her
face in her hands. The men pull
out their sheath knives and start
a rush, but stop when they find
themselves confronted by the revolvers
of Keeney and the Mate.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>his eyes and voice snapping</i>].
Hold still! [<i>The men stand huddled together
in a sullen silence. Keeney's voice
is full of mockery.</i>] You's found out it
ain't safe to mutiny on this ship, ain't
you? And now git for'ard where ye belong,
and&mdash;[<i>He gives Joe's body a contemptuous
kick.</i>] drag him with you.
And remember, the first man of ye I see
shirkin' I'll shoot dead as sure as there's
a sea under us, and you can tell the rest
the same. Git for'ard now! Quick!
[<i>The men leave in cowed silence, carrying
Joe with them. Keeney turns to the
Mate with a short laugh and puts his revolver
back in his pocket.</i>] Best get up
on deck, Mr. Slocum, and see to it they
don't try none of their skulkin' tricks.
We'll have to keep an eye peeled from
now on. I know 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out, right. Keeney hears
his wife's hysterical weeping and
turns around in surprise&mdash;then
walks slowly to her side.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>putting an arm around her
shoulder&mdash;with gruff tenderness</i>].
There, there, Annie. Don't be feared.
It's all past and gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>shrinking away from
him</i>]. Oh, I can't bear it! I can't bear
it any longer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Can't bear what,
Annie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>hysterically</i>]. All this
horrible brutality, and these brutes of
men, and this terrible ship, and this
prison cell of a room, and the ice all
around, and the silence.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>After this outburst she calms down
and wipes her eyes with her handkerchief.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>after a pause during which
he looks down at her with a puzzled
frown</i>]. Remember, I warn't hankerin'
to have you come on this voyage, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span>. I wanted to be with
you, David, don't you see? I didn't want
to wait back there in the house all alone
as I've been doing these last six years
since we were married&mdash;waiting, and
watching, and fearing&mdash;with nothing to
keep my mind occupied&mdash;not able to go
back teaching school on account of being
Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of
sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean.
I wanted to be by your side in the danger
and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to
see you the hero they make you out to be
in Homeport. And instead [<i>Her voice
grows tremulous</i>] all I find is ice and
cold&mdash;and brutality! [<i>Her voice
breaks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span>. I warned you what it'd be,
Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea
party," I says to you, "and you better
stay to home where you've got all your
woman's comforts." [<i>Shaking his head.</i>]
But you was so set on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>wearily</i>]. Oh, I know
it isn't your fault, David. You see, I
didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming
about the old Vikings in the story
books and I thought you were one of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>protestingly</i>]. I done my
best to make it as cozy and comfortable
as could be. [<i>Mrs. Keeney looks around
her in wild scorn.</i>] I even sent to the
city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it
might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it
times when they was calms and things was
dull like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>wearily</i>]. Yes, you were
very kind, David. I know that. [<i>She
goes to left and lifts the curtains from
the porthole and looks out&mdash;then suddenly
bursts forth</i>]: I won't stand it&mdash;I
can't stand it&mdash;pent up by these walls
like a prisoner. [<i>She runs over to him
and throws her arms around him, weeping.
He puts his arm protectingly over
her shoulders.</i>] Take me away from
here, David! If I don't get away from
here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go
mad! Take me home, David! I can't
think any more. I feel as if the cold and
the silence were crushing down on my
brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>holds her at arm's length and
looks at her face anxiously</i>]. Best go to
bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You
got fever. Your eyes look so strange
like. I ain't never seen you look this
way before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>laughing hysterically</i>].
It's the ice and the cold and the silence&mdash;they'd
make any one look strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. In a month or
two, with good luck, three at the most,
I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll
give her everything she'll stand and p'int
for home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney.</span> But we can't wait for
that&mdash;I can't wait. I want to get home.
And the men won't wait. They want to
get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you
to keep them. You must sail back.
You've got no excuse. There's clear
water to the south now. If you've a
heart at all you've got to turn back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>harshly</i>]. I can't, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney.</span> Why can't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> A woman couldn't rightly
understand my reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. Because it's a
stubborn reason. Oh, I heard you talking
with the second mate. You're afraid
the other captains will sneer at you because
you didn't come back with a full
ship. You want to live up to your silly
reputation even if you do have to beat
and starve men and drive me mad to
do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>his jaw set stubbornly</i>]. It
ain't that, Annie. Them skippers would
never dare sneer to my face. It ain't
so much what any one'd say&mdash;but&mdash;[<i>He
hesitates, struggling to express his
meaning</i>] you see&mdash;I've always done it&mdash;since
my first voyage as skipper. I
always come back&mdash;with a full ship&mdash;and&mdash;it
don't seem right not to&mdash;somehow.
I been always first whalin' skipper
out o' Homeport, and&mdash;don't you
see my meanin', Annie? [<i>He glances at
her. She is not looking at him, but staring
dully in front of her, not hearing a
word he is saying.</i>] Annie! [<i>She comes
to herself with a start.</i>] Best turn in,
Annie, there's a good woman. You ain't
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>resisting his attempts to
guide her to the door in rear</i>]. David!
Won't you please turn back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>gently</i>]. I can't, Annie&mdash;not
yet awhile. You don't see my meanin'.
I got to git the ile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney.</span> It'd be different if you
needed the money, but you don't. You've
got more than plenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. It ain't the
money I'm thinkin' of. D'you think I'm
as mean as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>dully</i>]. No&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;I can't understand. [<i>Intensely.</i>]
Oh, I want to be home in the old house
once more, and see my own kitchen again,
and hear a woman's voice talking to me
and be able to talk to her. Two years!
It seems so long ago&mdash;as if I'd been
dead and could never go back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>worried by her strange tone
and the far-away look in her eyes</i>.] Best
go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>not appearing to hear
him</i>]. I used to be lonely when you were
away. I used to think Homeport was a
stupid, monotonous place. Then I used
to go down on the beach, especially when
it was windy and the breakers were rolling
in, and I'd dream of the fine, free
life you must be leading. [<i>She gives a
laugh which is half a sob.</i>] I used to love
the sea then. [<i>She pauses; then continues
with slow intensity.</i>] But now&mdash;I don't
ever want to see the sea again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>thinking to humor her</i>]. 'Tis
no fit place for a woman, that's sure. I
was a fool to bring ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>after a pause&mdash;passing
her hand over her eyes with a gesture of
pathetic weariness</i>]. How long would it
take us to reach home&mdash;if we started
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>frowning</i>]. 'Bout two months,
I reckon, Annie, with fair luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>counts on her fingers&mdash;then
murmurs with a rapt smile</i>]. That
would be August, the latter part of August,
wouldn't it? It was on the twenty-fifth
of August we were married, David,
wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>trying to conceal the fact that
her memories have moved him&mdash;gruffly</i>].
Don't you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>vaguely&mdash;again passes
her hand over her eyes</i>]. My memory is
leaving me&mdash;up here in the ice. It was
so long ago. [<i>A pause&mdash;then she smiles
dreamily.</i>] It's June now. The lilacs
will be all in bloom in the front yard&mdash;and
the climbing roses on the trellis to
the side of the house&mdash;they're budding&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She suddenly covers her face with
her hands and commences to sob.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>disturbed</i>]. Go in and rest,
Annie. You're all worn out cryin' over
what can't be helped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>suddenly throwing her
arms around his neck and clinging to
him</i>]. You love me, don't you, David?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>in amazed embarrassment at
this outburst</i>]. Love you? Why d'you
ask me such a question, Annie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>shaking him <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'fierecly'">fiercely</ins></i>].
But you do, don't you, David? Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> I'm your husband, Annie,
and you're my wife. Could there be
aught but love between us after all these
years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>shaking him again&mdash;still
more fiercely</i>]. Then you do love me.
Say it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>simply</i>]. I do, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>gives a sigh of relief&mdash;her
hands drop to her sides. Keeney regards
her anxiously. She passes her hand
across her eyes and murmurs half to herself</i>]:
I sometimes think if we could only
have had a child&mdash;[<i>Keeney turns away
from her, deeply moved. She grabs his
arm and turns him around to face her&mdash;intensely.</i>]
And I've always been a good
wife to you, haven't I, David?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>his voice betraying his emotion</i>].
No man has ever had a better,
Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney.</span> And I've never asked
for much from you, have I, David? Have
I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> You know you could have all
I got the power to give ye, Annie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>wildly</i>]. Then do this,
this once, for my sake, for God's sake&mdash;take
me home! It's killing me, this life&mdash;the
brutality and cold and horror of it.
I'm going mad. I can feel the threat in
the air. I can't bear the silence threatening
me&mdash;day after gray day and every
day the same. I can't bear it. [<i>Sobbing.</i>]
I'll go mad, I know I will. Take
me home, David, if you love me as you
say. I'm afraid. For the love of God,
take me home!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She throws her arms around him,
weeping against his shoulder. His
face betrays the tremendous struggle
going on within him. He holds
her out at arm's length, his expression
softening. For a moment
his shoulders sag, he becomes old,
his iron spirit weakens as he looks
at her tear-stained face.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>dragging out the words with
an effort</i>]. I'll do it, Annie&mdash;for
your sake&mdash;if you say it's needful for
ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>with wild joy&mdash;kissing
him</i>]. God bless you for that, David!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He turns away from her silently
and walks toward the companion-way.
Just at that moment there
is a clatter of footsteps on the
stairs and the Second Mate enters
the cabin.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. The ice is breakin'
up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage
through the floe, and clear water
beyond, the lookout says.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Keeney straightens himself like a
man coming out of a trance. Mrs.
Keeney looks at the Mate with
terrified eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>dazedly&mdash;trying to collect
his thoughts</i>]. A clear passage? To no'the'ard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>his voice suddenly grim with
determination</i>]. Then get her ready and
we'll drive her through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Aye, aye, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>appealingly</i>]. David!
David!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>not heeding her</i>]. Will the
men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em
out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> They'll turn to willin' enough.
You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir.
They're meek as lambs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney.</span> Then  drive 'em&mdash;both
watches. [<i>With grim determination.</i>]
They's whale t'other side o' this floe and
we're agoin' to git 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate.</span> Aye, aye, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out hurriedly. A moment
later there is the sound of scuffling
feet from the deck outside and the
Mate's voice shouting orders.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>speaking aloud to himself&mdash;derisively</i>].
And I was agoin' home like
a yaller dog!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>imploringly</i>]. David!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. Woman, you ain't
adoin' right when you meddle in men's
business and weaken 'em. You can't
know my feelin's. I got to prove a man
to be a good husband for ye to take pride
in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Keeney</span> [<i>supplicatingly</i>]. David!
Aren't you going home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keeney</span> [<i>ignoring this question&mdash;commandingly</i>].
You ain't well. Go and lay
down a mite. [<i>He starts for the door.</i>]
I got to git on deck.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out. She cries after him
in anguish, "David!" A pause.
She passes her hand across her eyes&mdash;then
commences to laugh hysterically
and goes to the organ.
She sits down and starts to play
wildly an old hymn, "There is rest
for the weary." Keeney re&euml;nters
from the doorway to the deck and
stands looking at her angrily. He
comes over and grabs her roughly
by the shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene I:</span> <i>Atalanta, the novice, sits, rebellious
and sullen, on the steps of the
Mother Superior's da&iuml;s. From time to
time nuns and novices pass across the
stage to the left, on their way to the refectory.
Sister Grimana, an old nun,
comes down to Atalanta purposefully.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Sulking again, are you?
Waiting for Sister Benvenuta, are you?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta is silent.</i>]</p>

<p>Remembering things that are really no
concern of yours; and thinking they concern
you because you remember them&mdash;doubtless
quite inaccurately. I know.
It's a way of the Badoer family&mdash;and of
the Loredani, too, for that matter. When
you were a child there was confiture with
the bread&mdash;and you threw away the
crust; and they let you do it, and now
you can't find your vocation.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She taps her foot impatiently.</i>]</p>

<p>Well&mdash;well&mdash;will you come?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta is still silent, her face hard
with resolution.</i>]</p>

<p>I might mention it to the Sister Sacristan.
She'd fetch you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta gives her a look of scornful
disgust.</i>]</p>

<p>It's as well you didn't say that in so
many words, Sister.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta looks straight before her,
a statue of silence.</i>]</p>

<p>Perhaps there is some one you would
prefer to have me call, before the Sister
Sacristan comes to fetch you? Sister
Rosalba?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>No response.</i>]</p>

<p>So it must be Sister Benvenuta, must
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I would speak with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Oho!  You would speak
with her! And so you shall&mdash;for the
love I bore your mother when we were
children together. But what good she
can do you, with her chatter and laughing&mdash;childish
laughing and chatter&mdash;I
can't see. I'll send her to you. And
meantime, count your buttons. That's my
advice. Count your buttons.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She comes close and speaks more
confidentially.</i>]</p>

<p>That helps greatly&mdash;it did when I was
your age.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Grimana goes off. Atalanta mechanically
runs her fingers over the
buttons of her novice's cape; as she
arrives at the end of the row, she
mutters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Even  you,  Benvenuta!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>At the second word she rises
abruptly, her hands on the veil.</i>]</p>

<p>Heaven forgive me!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She tears off the veil just as Benvenuta
enters from the left. Benvenuta
limps down around the
Mother Superior's throne, and on
seeing Atalanta with her veil off,
bursts into laughter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Even  you,  Benvenuta!
What amuses you so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It's your hair. It's so
funny&mdash;it's so long since I've seen your
hair, Atalanta, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>sullenly</i>]. It's not that I
want to talk to you about. You needn't
have laughed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I know, dear. I shouldn't
have laughed, but I always do. I'm so
unworthy. I can't seem to help it,
though I tell myself, often and often,
that it's trifling and worldly to laugh so
much, and undignified, too, before the
children and novices. I will try not to
laugh, Atalanta. Sister Grimana said
you wanted me. What is it, dear?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She looks at Atalanta and smothers
another laugh.</i>]</p>

<p>Put on your veil, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Don't call me child&mdash;I'm
only three years younger than you, and
I'm taller.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She puts on the veil again, still
sullen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You're only a novice and
I call you a child&mdash;very properly, too.
And if you want me to talk to you, you
must listen&mdash;like a good child.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A step is heard approaching and a
rattle of keys; Atalanta pulls at
Benvenuta's dress as if to draw her
down beside her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> It's the Sister Sacristan.
Now she'll make me go, and there's something
you must tell me&mdash;you must&mdash;I
beg of you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan comes in and
goes straight to Atalanta, ignoring
Benvenuta. Her keys are audible
as she walks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sister Sacristan.</span> Well, Mistress
Perverse and Disobedient? Not come to
reason yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Pray you, Sister Sacristan,
pardon her. Let me speak with her
a little while&mdash;only a little while. Her
tasks can wait&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> Her tasks! Praise
the Blessed Mother, in this noble house we
need not depend on the novices for anything.
It's not that&mdash;it's the discipline
in the pigeon cot. The Mother Abbess
will be displeased&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Pray you, Sister Sacristan.
This novice has asked of me some
spiritual admonition. She is my kinswoman,
and I cannot refuse it. So I ask
you for a little time with her, to speak
to her of spiritual things, and perhaps
bring her some comfort, to the end that
her holy vocation may the sooner come.
I ask it in humility, Sister Sacristan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan</span> [<i>crossing to the
closet, which she unlocks</i>]. Admonition,
eh?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She takes out some vestments, which
she hangs over her arm, closing the
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I ask you to remember,
Sister, that last Thursday I took upon
myself the vexed matter of the hair of
the two new novices, and that it throve
in my charge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> Yes&mdash;throve. You
so coddled them that they cried for you
each night after, and are more trouble
to the lay sisters than ever. But since
she's your kinswoman&mdash;have it as you
will. I look for little effect from your
admonitions, I may as well tell you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She removes her keys and goes out,
without locking the closet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> That was good of you,
Benvenuta. Now, listen to me. I am
unworthy. I am unhappy. I feel no
call. Tell me&mdash;tell me about the
world, Sister Benvenuta&mdash;I beg you,
tell me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I will tell you of God's
love, and of this holy life&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>leading her to the stairway,
where she sits down</i>]. Yes&mdash;I know.
But first, tell me about the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I only tell you by way
of admonition&mdash;that you may see how
hollow is the world, and full of delusion&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I understand you. Go
on.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She draws Benvenuta down beside
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You must know then,
that I&mdash;even I, Sister Benvenuta, was a
most worldly little girl. I can remember
so clearly how I used to run madly
through the gardens, and roll on the
grass like&mdash;like a wild puppy, and bury
my face in the roses&mdash;till they scratched
my nose and the warm scent made me
dizzy. And then I would climb on the
wall and watch the barges go by, with
the strong men sculling them, and the
women under the awnings sorting crabs
and prawns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Tell me about the barge
people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> That was all I saw of
them. And then they would take me to
my lady mother, of a forenoon, while she
was having her hair powdered and
curled; and there would be a black page
bringing her chocolate, and her serving
cavalier would be leaning beside her
mirror taking snuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes&mdash;tell me about the
cavalier servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> That was all I ever saw
of him. But he was very worldly, I am
sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I wish you had seen more
of him. And your mother? Did she
have little children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You know well I was the
youngest of our family. That was why
I was destined for the benefice we possessed
in this high born convent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Tell me about your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I used only to see him
once in a month, and I was much frightened
of him&mdash;he was so noble and so
just.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Oh, he was a father of that
sort, was he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> And when he did receive
me, he had a handkerchief like a turban
around his head, and horn spectacles on
his nose, and he would be making gold
with an astrologer, or putting devils in
retorts. That was what he said he was
doing, but I know now that he deceived
me; he was a very worldly man, though
he was so noble and just.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Tell me, Benvenuta, when
you were in the world, did you ever see
mothers and babies&mdash;tiny babies&mdash;not
old at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> The only one was in the
picture in our chapel&mdash;the panel in the
center with the Blessed Mother and the
little Child Christ. He was so sweet,
and his eyes were as if they would open
in a moment and then I should know
what color of eyes they were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>glancing toward the Sacristy
closet</i>]. And that's why you so love
the Bambino they keep in the Sacristy
closet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>more passionately</i>]. And
was it easy for you, Benvenuta&mdash;always
easy in your heart, to give up the
world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I was destined for this,
dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>rising</i>]. I am not sure. I
was not destined. I am&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Ssh! Dear Atalanta. Be
quiet. Be calm. Yes, I was worldly,
and I gave it up willingly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes, it was easy for you,
and so you think it should be for me.
You never even saw a little baby with
her mother. You were destined, and you
were the youngest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It was for the best. I
was unworthy, but I gave up the world
willingly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. Willingly&mdash;you
were lame, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stops, biting her lips. There is
a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Yes. I was a little lame.
But I was a worldly little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Forgive me, dear sister.
I meant no hurt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You did not hurt me.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Another pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Dear Benvenuta, one thing
I must tell you. I must. It happened
just before I came here.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Benvenuta looks at her soberly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Are you sure it is to me
you should tell it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> It is not a sin&mdash;not something
I could confess, dear. It was this.
Just as you looked over the wall at the
barges, it was. In our gardens there
was a time when the old gardener brought
a vinedresser to help him. And the vinedresser's
wife came with his dinner and
their baby. And I came on them eating
under the ilex trees, very secretly, of
course. And the baby was clambering
over her. She was no older than I am
now&mdash;the vinedresser's wife. And she
fed the baby at her breast in the deep
shade under the ilexes. And I talked to
her. Then the old gardener came, and of
course I walked away, very haughtily, as
became a daughter of the house. But
hear me, sister. I cannot forget her, the
vinedresser's wife with the baby clambering
over her, under the shade of the
ilex trees, I cannot put her out of my
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I understand you, dear.
I cannot put out of my thoughts the poor
little Bambino in the Sacristy closet all
the year around, shut up with the saint's
bones and the spare vestments, and he
with only a piece of stiff purple and gold
stuff around his middle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I cannot think that the
same. The vinedresser's baby was alive&mdash;so
alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It is much the same, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Anyway, I am glad I told
you, Benvenuta. Why can I not forget
about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta</span> [<i>laying her hand on Atalanta's
head</i>]. It would be better if you
could forget it, Atalanta. You must go
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> One moment&mdash;don't take
your hand away. I had to tell somebody.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Both look off in a sort of dreamy
ecstasy, thinking of the two babies.
Grimana enters again. Atalanta
rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I am full of thankfulness,
Sister Benvenuta. I will go to my task.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta bows her head and follows
Grimana out. A muffled droning
chorus is heard from the chapel.
Benvenuta watches the others go
off, and then speaks to the Bambino
through the door of the Sacristy
closet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> My dear&mdash;my dear little
Great One, can you hear my voice through
the door? Dear little child Christ, I am
so sorry for you, alone for days and days
in the closet with the holy relics and the
wax lights. And at night it must be
very cold for you. I wish I might touch
you, dear little Great One, with my hands.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She tries the door and, finding it
unfastened, draws back from it a
moment.</i>]</p>

<p>It is open; the Sister Sacristan has left
it unlocked. For this I am thankful,
for I am sure you put it into her mind
to leave it so&mdash;or that you by your divine
power and foresight put it out of her
mind to lock it as she intended.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She opens the door and looks in.</i>]</p>

<p>If only I could get appointed Sacristan!
But I am too young and being lame would
prevent my getting on to the step-ladders,
as a Sacristan must. But I would never
leave you alone among the relics in their
cotton-wool, little Great One. And now&mdash;just
for a moment lest the Sister
Sacristan come back&mdash;I will take you
out of the closet.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She brings out the Bambino.</i>]</p>

<p>I will show you the chapter room,
for while you have seen all places, and
the high heavens and all the hells, it
will be pleasant to you to see the chapter
room, after so long in the closet. See,
yonder is the seat of the Mother Abbess.
She is very great, and very holy, and of
the high house of the Morosini. And
that way is to the refectory and the work
room. And that way is to the chapel&mdash;up
the stairs. And up that way are
our cells, where I sleep and where I
pray to dream of you, little Great One.
Touch my cheek, I pray you.... How
cold your hands are!... Touch my
cheek as she said the vinedresser's babe
touched his mother's&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stops suddenly, and then reverently
returns the Bambino to his
place. She kneels before the open
door.</i>]</p>

<p>Forgive me, dear little Child Christ.
I spoke not in vain glory. But all my
life I have waited, not knowing for what
... but happy ... dreaming that sometime....
If it be a sin I will confess
it&mdash;I will.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Again the rattle of keys is heard.
Benvenuta stands up hurriedly and
speaks in a half whisper.</i>]</p>

<p>She is coming back to lock the closet.
But I will get you a coat for the cold
nights. Your hands were so cold. I will
get you a warm coat&mdash;that I promise,
dear little Great One.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She closes the door and stands before
it looking consciously innocent,
as the Sister Sacristan enters.
The Sister Sacristan is not deceived,
however.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> By your leave, Sister
Benvenuta.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She ostentatiously locks the closed
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Sister Sacristan, I trust
the novice you left in my charge has returned
to her task.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan</span>. I trust she has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. I wish
I might help you with your duties sometimes,
Sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> I do not need you,
little sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I am sorry.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Mechanically she counts her buttons.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Enter the Abbess.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Abbess</span> [<i>to the Sacristan</i>]. Sister,
go into the chapel and tell the Reverend
Father that the Bolognese puppet man is
waiting, and say that I wish to see him
here; and bid the Reverend Father bring
the manuscript of his poem for Shrove
Tuesday.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan goes out. Benvenuta
remains, waiting patiently
for a word from the Abbess.</i>]</p>

<p>Well, my little sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I pray you, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I listen, little sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It is about the little
Child Christ. I pray you that a coat may
be made for him&mdash;a warm coat of soft
silk; for at Christmas he lies out in the
draughty manger before the altar, and
even at other times he is very cold at
night here in the Sacristy closet. And
I pray you, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I listen.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Re&euml;nter the Sister Sacristan.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> That I may help with the
making of the coat, for all that I sew so
badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Truly, our little sister
Benvenuta Loredan was born to be
the nursery-maid of Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> Is it for me to know
also, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Our little sister wishes that a
coat of warm silk be made for the little
Bambino, against next Christmas in the
cold of the chapel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> I suspected something
of that kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> You do not approve, sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister  Sacristan.</span> No,  mother.  It
would be taking the time and money from
the redressing of the skeleton of Saint
Prosdoscimus, which is a most creditable
relic, of unquestioned authenticity, with
real diamond loops in his eye holes; this
skeleton ought to be made fit to exhibit
for veneration. And besides, this Bambino
never had any clothes, and so far as
I know never wanted any. The purple
sash is only for modesty's sake. And as
for such a new-fangled proposal coming
from Sister Benvenuta&mdash;that alone&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span>  That will do. Fie, fie, little
sister. The Sacred Bambino is not your
serving Cavalier, that you should wish
to cover him with silk and velvet. Is the
Reverend Father coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> Immediately, mother.
He only stayed to gather his manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Call in the man with the puppets.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit Sister Sacristan.</i>]</p>

<p>And now, little sister, you may go.
You see it is not wise, ... your thought
for the Bambino.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> No, mother. I see it is
not wise.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Benvenuta goes up the staircase
and off at the left.&mdash;The Abbess

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> You are welcome, Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi</span> [<i>bowing very low</i>]. Happy
greetings, Reverendissima.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I have sent for you because
the puppet man, the Bolognese one you
sent for, has come to make his bargain
for the Shrove-tide play, and I wished
you to be present, lest he fail to serve
your inspiration worthily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I am grateful for your
care in the matter, Reverendissima.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> The fellow is waiting?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan bows.</i>]</p>

<p>Show him in.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan goes out.</i>]</p>

<p>And now, Father, I pray that you will
make terms for your play, as you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Perhaps I had better not
do that, Reverendissima. Poets are proverbially
improvident&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> That does not matter in the
least. Whatever he charges, I shall beat
him down.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan brings in the
Puppet Man, who carries a bag of
his puppets on his arm. He bows
extravagantly to the Abbess.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> Excellenza Reverendissima,
my prayers shall in the future be
lightened by the memory of your presence.
Reverend Father, I am humbly
your servant.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Abbess nods to Father Filosi.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> You have been summoned
here, sir, with regard to the Shrove
Tuesday play which her Excellenza condescends
to give for the edification of the
friends of this noble convent. She has
commissioned me to write the poem, and
she graciously proposes to allow you to
perform it with your puppets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> I am honored, and in
me all my craft is honored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I have here the manuscript
of my poor device.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> I cannot have so excellent
a work so slightly spoken of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> A trifle ... a trifle.
But I trust, when you have done your
part, it may amuse the novices and the
ladies&mdash;noble guests of Our Lady of the
Rosebush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> Is it from the gospels,
or a saint's story?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Humbly, it is the story
of Judith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> Humbly, as an artist, I
am filled with delight. And I have for
it just the figures you could wish. A
Judith, lovely beyond the power of song,
and a Prince, heavy with gold, and a
cavalier for the lady&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> That will not serve. In
my play she goes with only her maid-servant
to the tent of the Holophernes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> It is not usual, in Venice.
Will it not be deemed strange by
the ladies present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Better so, than its author
be deemed ignorant by the learned Reverendissima,
who will grace your performance
personally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man</span> [<i>stiffly</i>]. I bow to your
learning, Reverend Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> My poem will require of
you some artistry, and not all of the
stale and accustomed sort.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Puppet Man bows.</i>]</p>

<p>I shall require, for example, that the
head of the Holophernes be actually and
visibly severed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> I will undertake it, and
moreover, I will promise a goodly flow of
red blood from the corpus of the Holophernes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Excellent. Further, there
is required a Triumph of Judith, in a
car of state, and a figure of Time, speaking,
and a Religion, out of the clouds, who
speaks some verse in praise of the Reverendissima
and of the noble house of the
Morosini. All this must be carried out
precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> All this I undertake,
seeing how famous is this convent, and
of how illustrious a house is its Abbessa.
Suffer me to inquire if the entire poem is
of a lofty and tragic nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> This is a great honor to
me, but a ruinous one as well. For I
see I shall have no opportunity to bring
on my most potent figures&mdash;my Harlequino
with the seven wires, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Harlequino does not appear
in the poem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> But might he not appear
in an interlude? Let me suggest,
in all humility, that I might perform an
interlude between the Harlequino and
the serving-wench of Judith, after the
death of the Holophernes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Dio, dio&mdash;what a profanation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Come, come, your Reverence,
I see no profanation in it. We must not
be too severe&mdash;too lofty. Think of our
guests, and of the novices, mere children
in heart&mdash;who will be witnessing our
play. Let there be something in it for
the liking of all, I should say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> But, Reverendissima&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> I could assure you of
the success of the poem, if you would
permit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I am sure it will be permitted.
And now, sir, there are some other matters
to be settled. First, we shall require
that you bring here your puppets,
in advance of the play, for our inspection,
lest there be anything ungodly and
unfit about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> It is the custom. I have
brought some; and you shall have the
others when I have conned the reverend
Father's poem, and know which ones shall
be required.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Opens his bag and takes out puppets.</i>]</p>

<p>Here is a lady who might serve for
Judith. And here a Prince, though I
have a richer one, better perhaps for
the Holophernes. And here a devil&mdash;a
Satanasso, and here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Leave them all on the table.
I will have them examined at leisure.
Now, sir, tell me what you expect to be
paid for this performance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man</span> [<i>fingering his manuscript</i>].
Reverendissima, considering the
difficulties of the poem, and the Holophernes
to be visibly beheaded, and the
great fame of this convent, that is said to
require of every novice sixteen quarterings
to her crest and a thousand ducats of
dowry, and considering the illustrious
family of which the Abbessa herself
descends&mdash;I will perform the poem in
the best manner for twelve ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Considering just the matters
you mention, and the honor to you to
bring your puppets into this convent at
all, you shall have five ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> Five ducats&mdash;Reverendissima,
I cannot have heard you
aright&mdash;five ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Five ducats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man.</span> Mercy of the Saints!
Five ducats for Shrove Tuesday, and a
Holophernes to be visibly beheaded&mdash;in
a most illustrious convent, too. It is ruin
to me, Reverendissima&mdash;black ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Five ducats you shall have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man</span> [<i>starting to put his puppets
back in the bag</i>]. It is not possible,
Reverendissima. No one of my craft
could do it&mdash;even the worst of them
would ask more than I have. Mere jugglers
and bunglers from Padua would
ask twenty ducats. And the fame of this
convent! I see I have been deceived,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Be silent, sir. You cannot
trifle with me. Put down your trinkets.
Do you know who I am, and of what
family in the world? Well, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puppet Man</span> [<i>slowly putting down his
puppets again</i>]. Maybe it will profit me
in the sight of the Saints&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I need not warn you further.
Be prepared for the performance in the
best style against Shrove Tuesday. And
if all goes well, I may add a ducat to
your fee.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She taps a gong on the table, and

<p>Now, Father, since the play is yours,
it shall also be yours to pass on the
propriety of the figures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I do not seek the responsibility,
Reverendissima. Will you not
excuse me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> You have some intention in
this, Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Will you not excuse me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Certainly not. What
troubles you about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> Reverendissima, I would
gladly have passed it in silence. Your
wisdom in matters of the world&mdash;and of
the Church&mdash;is greater than mine. But
look you now. This Judith I think shows
more of her bosom than is seemly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess</span> [<i>with asperity</i>]. I will instruct
you. By the laws on the serene Republic,
a Venetian lady may show one-half of
her bosom and no more, and there is no
immodesty in the proceeding. This law
the lady Judith obeys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I do not dissent from
your wisdom, nor from the law of Venice.
Still, it seems to me there would be
more propriety in it if we were to have a
collarette of tissue pinned about her&mdash;the
eyes of all the novices, remember&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I remember also our guests,
many of them ladies of the first houses,
who would certainly take it amiss, and as
a reflection upon themselves&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I wish with all my heart,
Reverendissima, you had excused me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess</span> [<i>turning to Sister Sacristan</i>].
I will ask the Sisters Grimana Emo and
Rosalba Foscarini to examine the puppets.</p>

<p>Their learning in theology may not be
profound, but they know the world's
judgment, coming as they do of the first
families.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Abbe Filosi bows low.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbe Filosi.</span> I shall be at your service,
Reverendissima.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I thank you enough for the
poem. Farewell.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He bows himself out, at right, as

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> You have sent for us,
Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> In the matter of the Shrove
Tuesday play&mdash;yes. The puppets will
be brought in advance, as usual. These
few the show-man has already left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> You wish them to be looked
over, as usual?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Not quite as usual. This
year they are to appear in a play or poem
which the Father Confessor has written
for us&mdash;dealing with the story of Judith.
Now the good Abbe, though a man of
great learning and a graceful poet withal,
has not the advantage of family that some
of our sisters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> And some of our guests&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> I remember once, at a f&ecirc;te
in the gardens of my uncle, the Doge&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I need instruct you no further.
I do not wish anything ungodly or unfit
to appear; nor do I wish anything in the
play to suggest that there is any impropriety
in the illustrious audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> I understand, Mother. It
is chiefly a question of the dressing of
the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Precisely. I shall leave it in
your charge. Remembering, Sister
Grimana, the laws of Venice and the customs
of the house of your father, the
most illustrious Admiral, and you Sister
Rosalba, the f&ecirc;tes in the gardens of your
uncle, the Doge&mdash;surely it will be properly
cared for.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Exit the Abbess.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> All this because we have
been given a bourgeois Confessor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> No matter for that, Sister.
I love puppets. We had once a puppet
festival, when they played the whole history
of the Serene Republic, and there
were great ships with puppet sailors&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>They begin to separate the puppets

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Oh, the joy! Are these

we could show them to&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She glances toward the Sacristy

<p>Sister Rosalba, can you make them
dance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Dance, forsooth&mdash;to what
music, sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> You might sing for them,
Sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Aye, so I might.&mdash;Time
was when I knew tunes enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> There is a lute in the
cloister&mdash;left from the musical mass.
And my cousin Atalanta can play it&mdash;I
should like to hear some music
here.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She glances at the closet.</i>]</p>

<p>I'll fetch her.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She goes off to find Atalanta.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> What personages have we
here? This lady for Judith?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> That can scarcely be,
Judith was black haired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Nothing of the sort. She
had hair of a dark red&mdash;a smoldering
color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> Was she not of the tribe?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> What matters the tribe?
In her picture by Titian, in the great hall
of my father's house&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> We had a Judith also&mdash;by
Jacopo Bellini. He was Titian's master.
Her hair was black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> You may be right. In our
picture by Titian, now I remember it, the
head was so covered with a wonderful
jeweled crown that we could see little of
the hair.</p>

<p>Saint Mark preserve us! You are
queerly pleased, Sister. It's not many
that laugh at this figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba</span> [<i>reading the figure's label</i>].
He's Beelzebubb Satanasso, Prince of all
Devils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I pray your pardon. I
could not keep from laughing. I can
never look at a devil without laughing.
He seems so anxious to understand, and
so important with the responsibility of
being Prince of all Devils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> You may laugh if you like,
but you should remember how ready he
is to slip away with the unwary souls of
people who laugh at him. How he is
always in wait, by day and by night, for
a wavering thought or a rift in one's
faith&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> See here the pouch he carries
to put your soul in. Truly, Sister,
he might pluck you off like a cherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]. Dear Sister
Grimana&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> And he comes at the call
of the secret thought&mdash;that's what makes
him look so anxious&mdash;lest he should not
be listening when you call him, and the
Saints come to your soul first, and warn
it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Sister Grimana!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Still, I can never look at
him without laughing. He is droll. Atalanta,
the lute.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta brings forward the lute
and tries the strings. Rosalba

<p>I saw the show-man. He was a most
ill-favored man. Sister Rosalba, do you
think he was excommunicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> Of course not. And if he
were, that would not make his puppets
excommunicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> What if it did? A noble
convent has privileges. It would not
matter to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> What shall I play?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Can you play? [<i>She sings</i>]:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I do not know the air.
But I can play a furlana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> That will be gay, Atalanta.
Play a furlana, I beg you.</p>

the Judith and Rosalba the

does so two or three more nuns and
novices come furtively in at the
back and stand watching the performance.

puppets grows more animated the

Sacristan. For a moment the

continues. Then she speaks coldly

I have sinned in vain glory. I doubted.

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Prt! That's not what I
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You&mdash;you love me
enough to be troubled for my sake, a
little, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span> [<i>breaking out</i>]. I would
flout the Mother Abbess to her face for
you, Benvenuta. It's that you try to
keep me in the dark that I mind about it.
I'm going.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta turns sharply and goes.
Benvenuta lays out the little coat
of the gardener's child, and lays
her lawn, already cut, upon it.

over, and tries again. Then with
an air of resolution, she takes it
up and sews fiercely, pricking her
fingers, stopping to put them to
her mouth, and going on doggedly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I promised it, dear little
Great One, and I would give my soul to
keep my promise, but I fear me it will
never comfort you.</p>

every respect, but the size of a
small man. He bows low in a
mechanical sort of way as if
jointed. She gazes at him in wonder,

her laughter.</i>]</p>

you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> You know who I am.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He points to his label.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I know. You are Beelzebubb
Satanasso, Prince of all Devils.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She suppresses a laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> You have made a promise,
and you cannot keep it, so you call
for help. I come, for I am always ready.
Now tell me precisely what it is you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I have promised a coat
to the little Child&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> That will do. It were
better not to speak the name. What sort
of a coat do you wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> May I have just what I
like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> Certainly you may, my
dear&mdash;if you are ready to pay for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I am ready. And I
should like a little coat like the one on
the second of the Magi in the Adoration
by Bellini that is over the altar in our
chapel at home&mdash;in the house of the
Duke Loredano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> Let me understand exactly.
The coat is to be like the coat on
the second figure to the left from the center
of the picture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Yes&mdash;no, there's a Saint
Joseph also at the back. He would be
the third&mdash;from the Holy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> I pray you, keep the
names of these people out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> These people!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Benvenuta's hand moves as if she
were about to cross herself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> And let your hand fall.
You were about to make&mdash;to make some
sort of sign with it. These practices are
very distasteful to me. I cannot help
you&mdash;or even stay for an interview&mdash;if
you persist in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I beg your forgiveness.
I had no intention&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> I believe that&mdash;it is
merely a habit you have learned&mdash;but it
is distasteful to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I will not offend you
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> Now to business. You
wish of me a coat, a rich coat like that on
the third figure from the center of the
picture that is in your father's chapel at
Venice. And the size&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> To fit the little Child&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb</span> [<i>interrupting sharply</i>]. I
beg of you! I understand. The coat is
of what color?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It is the coat of the second
of the Magi&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He puts up his hand, and she checks
herself.</i>]</p>

<p>It is of carmine silk damask with gold
thread, and the inner vest is of white
lawn. I wish it precisely like the picture,
since you promise so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> It shall be so. I will
undertake to bring you the coat. And in
exchange I ask only that you sign your
name here.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He takes out a parchment contract,

<p>I regret that ink will not do. You
must prick one of your fingers. I am
very sorry, but there is no other way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Prick my finger? Once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> Only once, to secure the
drop of blood. I am sorry to ask it,
but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> As though it never happened
to me before!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She pricks her finger and squeezes

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> And what does it say? I
should be loath to sign anything unworthy
of my family, or of this noble
convent&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beelzebubb.</span> There is nothing novel
about it&mdash;the form is quite usual, and
has been signed, I assure you, by many
of the highest families in Venice. It
merely binds me at once to furnish you
the rich coat, and you to give me your
little flame of a soul&mdash;when I come for
it. That is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Give me the pen.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She signs the contract. He passes
his hand thrice across the pouch

are to be indulged. I beg you, so inform
the sisters.</p>

places. I know the hour is late for them,

night. Stay.&mdash;The novice Atalanta

her lute.</p>

Reverend Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> And the vestments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> The vestments are
all in order&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She is about to mention something
about the vestments, but stops herself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> I must report, as a
matter of duty, Reverend Mother, that
certain goods&mdash;a piece of fine lawn&mdash;cannot
be found. It was laid out here
to be used for the new surplice for His
Eminence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I do not like this. Tell me
what you know of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan</span>. This is all I know.
Except that when I returned here, the
door to the Sacristy Closet was open&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Who was here at the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> Sister Benvenuta
was left here. When I returned she was
gone, and the closet was open, and the
lawn&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana</span> [<i>interceding</i>]. I beg you,
Reverend Mother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Sister Grimana, I have given
you your task. Be about it.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Grimana touches the buttons of her
cape one by one, and then turns

<p>Sister, remember that the Sister Benvenuta
comes of the noble house of the
Loredani. Guard your tongue.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Sister Sacristan stands gloomily
biting her lips.</i>]</p>

<p>If she has removed the cloth to some
other place, it does not matter. Remember
who she is, and that she is after all
a child in mind, in heart. We will speak
no more of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> No, Reverend
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess</span>. Send Sister Rosalba to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sister Sacristan.</span> She is coming now,
Reverend Mother.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Rosalba comes in and the Sister
Sacristan goes out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> I wish to speak with Benvenuta,
Sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> I will fetch her, Reverend
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> One moment. You have observed
her of late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> Yes, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> She seems pale, and not so
strong as she was. And her mind&mdash;but
then she was always a simple child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> Of course, I do not know
the cause of her pallor. Perhaps a penance
she is undergoing secretly.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The suggestion is half a question
as are those of the Abbess as
well.</i>]</p>

<p>She is still very young, Reverend
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> She has confided nothing to
you, nor to Grimana?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalba.</span> Not to me, Mother. Shall
I call Sister Grimana?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> No. Send Benvenuta to me.
And ask Grimana to send the novice Atalanta
also&mdash;a little later.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Rosalba goes out. The Abbess goes
over and examines the Sacristy
Closet door, tries the lock, finds it
fast, and returns to her chair.
Benvenuta enters. She is more
pale than before, and looks frailer,
and her limp is more apparent, but
her eyes are wide, and rove about
the room, and her expression is of
one who has found her happiness.
The Abbess speaks to her kindly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> My child, I have called you
to me because you have seemed so pale,
and I fear you have burdened yourself
beyond your strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> No, Reverend Mother. I
am not burdened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> You are not performing any
secret penance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> None, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Answer me truly, Benvenuta.
You have not been contemplating some
penance, and so been filled with anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I look for no penance in
this life, Reverend Mother, beyond such
as may be imposed upon me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> Nothing beyond your strength
will be imposed. If you have need of
more sleep, I would be willing to relax
for you, for a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I do not need it, Reverend
Mother.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Atalanta steps forward. Benvenuta
starts to go, but lingers.</i>]</p>

<p>I shall need your help with the lute to-night.
I know you play it well. The
best lute player among the lay sisters
is ill. You can play from notes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> If it be not too difficult,
Reverend Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbess.</span> It is simple. But I will have
them give you the music, against the time
when you will be needed.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Abbess goes out toward the
Chapel. Benvenuta comes down to
Atalanta.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Atalanta, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes, Benvenuta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> There is something I
must talk to you about. I have put it
off because I have been deep in my own
thoughts. You told me not so long ago
that you could not find your call, that
the world still beckoned you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes, it did. But I have
been calmer since we spoke of it. There
was a thing in my heart that had to be
spoken out&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I spoke it out to you, and
since then it has not troubled me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> It was about the vinedresser's
baby in your father's garden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> You told me about it here&mdash;in
this room, was it not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Yes. Surely it was here.
How strangely you speak, Benvenuta.
Have you forgotten? It was after that
you asked me to get the gold thread, and
the child's coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> So I did. I had almost
forgotten it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> It was a great comfort to
me to tell you, Sister&mdash;and to serve you.
Why have you asked nothing more of
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I have all the help I
need, now.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A pause. Atalanta looks at Benvenuta
wonderingly.</i>]</p>

<p>The vinedresser's baby&mdash;did you ever
hold him in your arms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Nor ever felt his lips
soft and moist against your cheek, nor
his fingers warm on your neck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> No. I only saw the child,
as I told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> I remember now. You
only saw him.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Another pause. Benvenuta is looking
toward the Sacristy closet.</i>]</p>

<p>Atalanta, dear, do you know that we
can only be happy by pleasing those we
love most&mdash;that is what people live for,
I think. And dear, remember this: the
happiness you saw on the face of the
vinedresser's wife was as torment beside
the joy that is glowing in me.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Her eyes meet Atalanta's for a moment.</i>]</p>

<p>Don't, dear&mdash;don't think it too strange.
Everything is strange, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> Your face was like hers,
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benvenuta.</span> Please don't say that,
dear. It's&mdash;it's foolish&mdash;isn't it? But
I told you once I was waiting for something&mdash;all
my life waiting. And now&mdash;and
now!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She touches Atalanta's head, lightly,
and goes off upstairs toward her

seen her? Have you?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grimana.</span> Yes, dear, I've seen. She's
young. These times come to all of us,
I suppose. But they pass. Calm, child.
Count your buttons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atalanta.</span> I was frightened, Sister
Grimana.</p>

novices just so in your turn. But just
the same, I wish she wouldn't&mdash;</p>

August, at the present time.</i></p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene:</span> <i>A darkened room. After a
moment the door opens, admitting a
streak of light. A man peers in cautiously.
As soon as he is sure that the
room is unoccupied, he steps inside and
feels along the wall until he finds the
switch which floods the room with light.
He is dressed in impeccable taste&mdash;evidently
a man of culture. From time to
time he bites appreciatively on a ham
sandwich as he looks about him, apparently
viewing the room for the first
time. Nothing pleases him until a vase
over the mantel catches his eye. He
picks it up, looks at the bottom, puts it
down hard, and mutters, "Imitation."
Other articles receive the same disdainful
verdict. The whole room is beneath
his notice. He starts to sit down before
the fire and enjoy his sandwich. Suddenly
he pauses to listen, looks about
him hurriedly for some place to hide,
thinks better of it, and takes his stand
opposite the door, smiling pleasantly and
expectantly. The door opens and a
young woman enters with a man at her
heels. As she sees the thief she stifles
a scream and retreats, backing the man
out behind her. The thief smiles and
waits. Soon the door opens again, and
the man enters with the woman clinging
to him. They stand opposite the thief
and stare at him, not sure what they
ought to say or do.</i>]</p>

[<i>Pause.</i>] Good evening, good evening.
You surprised me. Can't say I expected
you home so soon. Was the play an
awful bore? [<i>Pause.</i>] We-e-ell, can't
one of you speak. I CAN carry on a
conversation alone, but the question-and-answer
method is usually preferred. If
one of you will ask me how I do, we
might get a step farther.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>].  You&mdash;you&mdash;[<i>With
growing conviction.</i>] You're a
thief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Exactly. And you, madame?
The mistress of the house, I presume.
Or are you another thief? The traditional
one that it takes to catch the
first?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> This&mdash;this is OUR house.
Charles, why don't you do something?
Don't stand there like a&mdash;Make him go
away! Tell him he mustn't take anything.
[<i>Advancing toward the thief and
speaking all in one sentence.</i>] What
have you taken? Give it to me instantly.
How dare you! Charles, take it away
from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>apparently not afraid, a
little amused, but uncertain what to do,
finally adopting the bullying tone.</i>] I
say, old man, you'd better clear out.
We've come home. You know you can't&mdash;come
now, give it up. Be sensible. I
don't want to use force&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I don't want you to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> If you've got anything of
ours&mdash;We aren't helpless, you know.
[<i>He starts to draw something black and
shiny from his overcoat pocket. It
might be a pistol, but he does not reveal
its shape.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Let's see those glasses. Give
them here. [<i>Takes them from the uncertain
Charles.</i>] Perhaps they're better
than mine. Fine cases. [<i>Tries them.</i>]
Humph! Window glass! Take them
back. You're not armed, you know. I
threw your revolver down the cold-air
shaft. Never carry one myself&mdash;in
business hours. Yours was in the bottom
of your bureau drawer. Bad shape,
those bureau drawers were in. Nice and
neat on top; rat's nest below. Shows up
your character in great shape, old man.
Always tell your man by his bureau
drawers. Didn't it ever occur to you
that a thief might drop in on you some
night? What would he think of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I don't think&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You should. I said to myself
when I opened that drawer: "They put
up a great surface, but they're shams.
Probably streak that runs through everything
they do." You ought to begin
with real neatness. This other sort of
thing is just a form of dishonesty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> You! Talking to US about
honesty&mdash;in our house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Just the place for honesty.
Begin at home. Let's&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles, I won't stand this?
Grab hold of him. Search him. You
hold him. I'll telephone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> You've cut the wires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Didn't have to. Your telephone
service has been cut off by the
company. I found that out before I
came. I suspect you neglected the bill.
You ought not to, makes no end of trouble.
Inconvenienced me this evening.
Better get it put in right away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles, do I have to stand
here and be insulted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Sit down. Won't you, please!
This is your last ham-sandwich, so I
can't offer you any, but there's plenty
of beer in the cellar, if you care for it.
I don't recommend it, but perhaps you're
used to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>almost crying</i>]. Charles, are
you going to let him preach to us all
night! I won't have it. Being lectured
by a thief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> You can't stop a man's talking,
my dear, especially this sort of
man. Can't you see he's a born preacher?
Old man, while advice is going round,
let me tell you that you've missed your
calling. Why don't you go in for reform?
Ought to go big.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Oh, Charles! Don't talk to
him. You're a good deal bigger than
he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Maybe I'll jiu-jitsu him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> He's insulting you now,
Charles. Please try. I'll hold his feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> No doubt you would. But
that wouldn't stop my talking. You'd
be taking an unfair advantage, too; I
couldn't kick a lady, could I? Besides,
there are two of you. You leave it to
Charles and me. Let's have fair play,
at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Fair play? I'd like to know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Ple-e-ase, don't screech! My
head aches and your voice pierces so.
Let's sit down quietly and discuss the
situation like well-bred people, and when
we've come to some understanding, I'll
go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Yes, after you've taken everything
in the house and criticized everything
else you can't take, our manners
and our morals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> But he isn't taking anything
now, is he? Let the poor chap
criticize, can't you? I don't suppose he
often meets his&mdash;er&mdash;customers socially.
He's just dying for a good old
visit. Lonesome profession, isn't it, old
man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> If you WON'T do anything,
I'll call the neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> No neighbors to call. Nearest
one a block away, and he isn't at
home. That comes of living in a fashionable
suburb. Don't believe you can
afford it, either. WON'T you sit down,
madame? I can't till you do. Well, then
I shall have to stand, and I've been on
my feet all day. It's hardly considerate
[<i>plaintively</i>]. I don't talk so well on
my feet, either. It will take me much
longer this way. [<i>Clara bounces into a
chair, meaningfully.</i>] Thank you, that's
better [<i>sighs with relief as he sinks into
the easy chair</i>]. I knew I could appeal
to your better nature. Have a cigarette?
[<i>Charles accepts one from his
beautiful case.</i>] And you, madame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>puts out her hand, but withdraws
it quickly</i>]. Thank you, I don't
care to smoke&mdash;with a thief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Right. Better not smoke, anyway.
I'm so old-fashioned, I hate to see
women smoke. None of the women in
my family do it. Perhaps we're too conventional&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't know that I care to be
like the women of your family. I <i>will</i>
have one, if you please. No doubt you
get them from a man of taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Your next-door neighbor. This
is&mdash;was&mdash;his case. Exquisite taste.
Seen this case often, I suppose? [<i>He
eyes them closely.</i>] Great friends? Or
perhaps you don't move in the same circles.
[<i>Clara glares at him.</i>] Pardon
me. Tactless of me, but how could I
guess? Well, here's your chance to get
acquainted with his cigarettes. Will you
have one now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't receive stolen goods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> That's a little hard on Charles,
isn't it? He seems to be enjoying his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Bully cigarette. Hempsted's
a connoisseur. Truth is&mdash;we don't know
the Hempsteds. They've never called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> That's right, Charles. Tell
the truth and shame [<i>with a jerk of his
head toward Clara</i>]&mdash;you know who.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles, there isn't any reason,
I'm sure&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Quietly, please. Remember
my head. I'm sorry, but I must decline
to discuss your social prospects with
you, and also your neighbors' shortcomings,
much as we should all enjoy it.
There isn't time for that. Let's get down
to business. The question we've got to
decide and decide very quickly is, What
would you like to have me take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>aghast</i>]. What would we&mdash;what
would we like to have you take?
Why&mdash;why&mdash;you can't take anything
now; we're here. Of all the nerve!
What would we like&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> It gains by repetition, doesn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> You've got me, old man.
You'll have to come again. I may be
slow, but I don't for the moment see
the necessity for your taking anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I was afraid of this. I'll have
to begin farther back. Look here now,
just suppose I go away and don't take
anything [<i>with an air of triumph</i>]. How
would you like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Suits me to a "T." How
about you, my dear? Think you can be
firm and bear up under it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Don't be sarcastic. You're too
big. Only women and little men should
be sarcastic. Besides, it isn't fair to
me, when I'm trying to help you. Here
am I, trying to get you out of a mighty
ticklish situation, and you go and get
funny. It isn't right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Beg pardon, old man. Try
us in words of one syllable. You see this
is a new situation for us. But we're anxious
to learn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Listen, then. See if you can
follow this. Now there's nothing in your
house that I want; nothing that I could
for a moment contemplate keeping without
a good deal of pain to myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> We're trying to spare you.
But if you care to know, we had the
advice of Elsie de Wolfe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>wonderingly</i>]. Elsie de Wolfe?
Elsie, how could you! Now, if you had
asked me to guess, I should have said&mdash;the
Pullman Company. I shudder to
think of owning any of this bric-a-brac
myself. But it must be done. Here am
I offering to burden myself with something
I don't want, wouldn't keep for
worlds, and couldn't sell. [<i>Growing a
little oratorical.</i>] Why do I do this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes, why do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Hush, Charles; it's a rhetorical
question; he wants to answer it himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I do it to accommodate you.
Must I be even plainer? Imagine that
I go away, refusing to take anything in
spite of your protests. Imagine it's to-morrow.
The police and the reporters
have caught wind of the story. Something
has been taken from every house
in Sargent Road&mdash;except one. The nature
of the articles shows that the thief
is a man of rare discrimination. To be
quite frank&mdash;a connoisseur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> A connoisseur of what?
Humph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> And a connoisseur of such
judgment that to have him pass your
Rubens by is to cast doubt upon its
authenticity. I do not exaggerate. Let
me tell you that from the Hempsteds&mdash;[<i>Clara
leans forward, all interest.</i>]&mdash;but
that would take too long. [<i>She leans
back.</i>] The public immediately asks,
Why did the thief take nothing from
2819 Sargent Road? The answer is too
obvious: There is nothing worth taking
at 2819 Sargent Road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>comprehendingly</i>]. Um-hu-m!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> The public laughs. Worse
still, the neighbors laugh. What becomes
of social pretensions after that?
It's a serious thing, laughter is. It puts
anybody's case out of court. And it's a
serious thing to have a thief pass you
by. People have been socially marooned
for less than that. Have I made myself
clear? Are you ready for the question?
What would you like to have me take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Now, old man, I say that's
neat. Sure you aren't a lawyer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I have studied the law&mdash;but
not from that side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It's all bosh. Why couldn't
we claim we'd lost something very valuable,
something we'd never had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>solemnly</i>]. That's the most
shameless proposal I've ever heard. Yes,
you could <i>lie</i> about it. I can't conceal
from you what I think of your moral
standards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I can't imagine you concealing
anything unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It's no worse than&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Your moral sense is blunted.
But I can't attend to that now. Think
of this: Suppose, as I said, I should take
nothing and you should publish that
bare-faced lie, and then I should get
caught. Would I shield you? Never.
Or suppose I shouldn't get caught. Has
no one entered your house since you
have been here? Doesn't your maid know
what you have? Can you trust her not
to talk? No, no, it isn't worth the risk.
It isn't even common sense, to say nothing
of the moral aspects of the case.
Why do people never stop to think of the
practical advantages of having things
stolen! Endless possibilities! Why, a
woman loses a $5 brooch and it's immediately
worth $15. The longer it stays
lost, the more diamonds it had in it,
until she prays God every night that it
won't be found. Look at the advertising
she gets out of it. And does she
learn anything from it? Never. Let a
harmless thief appear in her room and
she yells like a hyena instead of saying
to him, like a sensible woman: "Hands
up; I've got you right where I want you;
you take those imitation pearls off my
dresser and get to hell out of here. If
I ever see you or those pearls around
here again, I'll hand you over to the
police." That's what she ought to say.
It's the chance of her life. But unless
she's an actress, she misses it absolutely.
A thief doesn't expect gratitude, but it
seems to me he might at least expect understanding
and intelligent co&ouml;peration.
Here are you facing disgrace, and here
am I willing to save you. And what do
I get? Sarcasm, cheap sarcasm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I beg your pardon, old man.
I'm truly sorry. You're just too advanced
for us. Clara, there's an idea
in it. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It has its possibilities. Now if
he'll let me choose&mdash;Isn't there a joker
in it somewhere? Let me think. We
might let you have something. What
do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]. What do I
want? I&mdash;don't want&mdash;anything. Can't
you see that? The question is, What do
you want me to have? And please be a
little considerate. Don't ask me to take
the pianola or the ice-box. Can't you
make up your minds? Let me help you.
Haven't you got some old wedding gifts?
Everybody has. Regular white elephants,
yet you don't dare get rid of them for
fear the donors will come to see you and
miss them. A discriminating thief is a
godsend. All you have to do is write:
"Dear Maude and Fred: Last night
our house was broken into, and of course
the first thing that was taken was that
lovely Roycroft chair you gave us." Or
choose what you like. Here's opportunity
knocking at your door. Make it
something ugly as you please, but something
genuine. I hate sham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles, it's our chance.
There's that lovely, hand-carved&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Stop! I saw it [<i>shuddering</i>].
It has the marks of the machine all over
it. Not that. I can't take that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Beggars shouldn't be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Where's my coat? That settles
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Oh, don't go! I didn't mean
it. Honestly I didn't. It just slipped
out. You mustn't leave us like this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I don't have to put up with
such&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Oh, please stay, and take
something! Haven't we anything you
want? Charles, hold him; don't let him
go. No, that won't do any good. Talk
to him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Don't be so sensitive, old
man. She didn't mean it. You know
how those old sayings slip out&mdash;just say
themselves. She only called you a little
beggar anyway. You ought to hear what
she calls me sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I don't want to. I'm not her
husband. And I don't believe she does
it in the same way, either. But I'm not
going to be mean about this. I'll give
you another chance. Trot out your
curios.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> How about this? Old luster
set of Clara's grandmother's. I'm no
judge of such things myself, but if you
could use it, take it. Granddad gave it
to her when they were sweethearts, didn't
he, Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> That! Old luster? That jug
won't be four years old its next birthday.
Don't lay such things to your
grandmother. Have some respect for
the dead. If you gave more than $3.98
for it, they saw you coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> You don't know anything
about it. You're just trying to humiliate
us because you know you have the
upper hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> All right. Go ahead. Take
your own risks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> There's this Sheffield tray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Do you like Wedgewood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Yes, where is it? [<i>Looks at
it.</i>] No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> This darling hawthorne vase&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Please take it away. It isn't
hawthorne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I suppose Cloisonn&eacute;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span>. If they were any of them
what you call them. But they aren't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Well, if you'd consider
burnt wood. That's a genuine burn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Nothing short of cremation
would do it justice. Of course I've got
to take one of them, if they're all you've
got. But honestly, there isn't one genuine
thing in this house, except Charles&mdash;and&mdash;and
the ham sandwich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>takes miniature from cabinet</i>].
I wonder if you would treasure this as
I do. It's very dear to me. It's grandmother&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. Grandmother
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> As a little girl. Painted on
ivory. See that quaint old coral necklace.
And those adorable yellow curls.
And the pink circle comb. Would you
like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Trying to appeal to my sympathy.
I've a good notion to take it to
punish you. I wonder if it IS your
grandmother. There isn't the slightest
family resemblance. Look here!&mdash;it is!&mdash;it's
a copy of the Selby miniature!
Woman, do you know who that IS?
It's Harriet Beecher Stowe at twelve.
What have you done with my overcoat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span>  I give up.  Here it is.
Clara, that was too bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I wanted to see if he'd know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> There's no use trying to
save us after this. We'll just have to
bear the disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Charles, you're a trump! I'll
even take that old daub for YOU. Give
it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Wait a minute. You won't
have to. Say, Clara, where is that old
picture of Cousin Paul? It's just as bad
as it pretends to be, if genuineness is
all you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>suspiciously</i>]. Who is Cousin
Paul? Don't try to ring in Daniel Webster
on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Cousin of mine. Lives on
a farm near Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You don't claim the picture
is by Sargent or Whistler?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It couldn't be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>ignoring her pointedly</i>]. Do
you, Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Certainly not. It's a water
color of the purest water, and almost a
speaking likeness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I'll take Cousin Paul. Probably
he has human interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> That's the last thing I
should have thought of in connection
with Cousin Paul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Bring him, but wrapped,
please. My courage might fail me if I
saw him face to face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>leaving room for picture</i>].
Mine always does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> While Charles is wrapping up
the picture, I want to know how you
got back so early. Your maid said you
were going to the Garrick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> We told her so. But we went
to the moving pictures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You ought not to go to the
movies. It will destroy your literary
taste and weaken your minds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't care for them myself,
but Charles won't see anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You ought to make him. Men
only go to the theater anyway because
their wives take them. They'd rather
stay at home or play billiards. You
have a chance right there. Charles will
go where you take him. By and by he
will begin to like it. Now to-night there
was a Granville Barker show at the
Garrick, and you went to the movies to
see a woman whose idea of cuteness is to
act as if she had a case of arrested
mental development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>entering, doing up picture</i>].
Silly old films, anyway. But Clara will
go. Goes afternoons when I'm not here,
and then drags me off again in the
evening. Here's your picture, as soon
as I get it tied up. Can't tell you how
grateful we are. Shall we make it unanimous,
Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I haven't the vote, you know.
Clumsy! give me the picture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Don't try to thank me. If
you'll give up this shamming I'll feel
repaid for my time and trouble [<i>looking
at watch</i>]. By Jove! it's far too much
time. I must make tracks this minute.
I'll feel repaid if you'll take my advice
about the theater for one thing, and&mdash;why
don't you bundle all this imitation
junk together and sell it and get one
genuine good thing?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Clara leaves, apparently for more
string.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Who'd buy them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> There must be other people in
the world with taste as infallibly bad as
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Call that honest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Certainly. I'm not telling you
to sell them as relics. You couldn't in
the first place, except to a home for the
aged and indigent blind. But I know a
man who needs them. They'd rejoice
his heart. They'd be things of beauty
to him. I wish I could help you pick
out something with your money. But I
don't dare risk seeing you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>re&euml;ntering, with the picture
tied</i>]. Why not? There's honor among
thieves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> There <i>is</i>. If you were thieves,
I'd know just how far to trust you.
Now, I'd be willing to trust Charles as
man to man. Gentleman's agreement.
But [<i>looking at Clara</i>] I don't know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Clara is just as honest as
we are&mdash;with her own class. But your
profession puts you outside the pale
with her; you're her natural enemy. You
haven't any rights. But you've been a
liberal education for us both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I've been liberal. You meet
me&mdash;listen!&mdash;there are footsteps on
the porch. I&mdash;I've waited too long.
Here I've stood talking&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Well, stop it now, can't you?
I don't see how you've ever got anywhere.
Hide!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> No, it can't be done. If you'll
play fair, I'm safe enough here in this
room, safer than anywhere else. Pretend
I'm a friend of yours. You will?
Gentleman's agreement? [<i>He shakes
hands with Charles.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Gentleman's agreement. My
word of honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>offers her hand as Charles
starts for the door</i>]. Gentleman's agreement,
but only in this. I haven't forgiven
you for what you've said. If I
ever get you in a tight place&mdash;look
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>taking her hand</i>]. Don't tell
more than one necessary lie. It's so easy
to get started in that sort of thing.
Stick to it that I'm a friend of the family
and that I've been spending the evening.
God knows I have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I'll try to stick to that. But
can't I improvise a little? It's such
fun!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Not a bit. Not one little
white lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>entering with a young man
behind him</i>]. It's a man from the <i>News</i>.
He says he was out here on another
story and he's got a big scoop. There's
been some artistic burglary in the neighborhood
and he's run onto it. I told him
we hadn't lost anything and that we
don't want to get into the papers; but
he wants us to answer a few questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Please do. I need some
stuff about the neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't know, Charles, but
that it's our duty. [<i>She smiles wickedly
at the thief.</i>] Something we say
may help catch the thieves. Perhaps we
owe it to law and order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> That's right. Would you
object if I used your name?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Charles and the thief motion to
Clara to keep still, but throughout
the rest of the conversation she
disregards their frantic signals,
and sails serenely on.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't know that we should
mind if you mention us nicely. Will the
Hempsteds be in? I shan't mind it, if
they don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Good for you. Now, have
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> We have missed something.
We haven't had time to look thoroughly,
but we do know that one of our pictures
is gone.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The men are motioning to her, but
she goes on sweetly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> A-a-ah! Valuable picture.
He hasn't taken anything that wasn't
best of its class. Remarkable chap.
Must be the same one that rifled the
Pierpont collection of illuminated manuscripts.
Culled the finest pieces without
a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>interested</i>]. He made one big
mistake. He&mdash;[<i>stops short</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Know the Pierponts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Er&mdash;ye-es. I've been in their
house. [<i>Retires from the conversation.
Clara smiles.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Well, believe me, if he's
taken anything, your reputation as collectors
is made. Picture, eh? Old master,
I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> A family portrait. We treasured
it for that. Associations, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Must have been valuable,
all right. Depend on him to know. He
doesn't run away with any junk. Who
was the artist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> We don't know&mdash;definitely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Never heard it attributed
to anybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> We don't care to make any
point of such things. But there have
been people who have thought&mdash;it was
not&mdash;a&mdash;a Gilbert Stuart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Clara!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don't know much about such
things myself. But our friend [<i>nods toward
the thief</i>], Mr.&mdash;Mr. Hibbard&mdash;who
has some reputation as a collector,
has always said that it was&mdash;not. In
spite of that fact, he had offered to take
it off our hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Clara, you're going too
far&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> She's quite right. You're
wrong, Mr. Hibbard. You may be good,
but this fellow KNOWS. Too bad you
didn't take it while the taking was good.
This fellow never sells. Of course he
can't exhibit. Just loves beautiful
things. No, sir, it was real.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>between his teeth</i>]. It wasn't.
Of all the&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. You take your beating
so ungracefully, Mr. Hibbard. The
case, you see, is all against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Be careful. The picture may
be found at any minute. Don't go too
far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I hardly think it will be found
unless the thief is caught. And I have
such perfect confidence in his good sense
that I don't expect that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Lots of time for a getaway.
When was he here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> He was gone when we came
from the theater. But we must almost
have caught him. Some of our finest
things were gathered together here on
the table ready for his flight. How he
must have hated to leave them, all the
miniatures and the cloisonn&eacute;. I almost
feel sorry for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> You see, we went to the Garrick
for the Granville Barker show. Mr.
Hibbard took us [<i>she smiles sweetly at
him</i>]. I'm devoted to the best in drama
and I always insist that Charles and Mr.
Hibbard shall take me only to the finest
things. And now we come home to find
our&mdash;you're sure it was a Gilbert
Stuart?&mdash;gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> I've got to be getting out of
here! Can't stay a minute longer!
Charles, I wish you luck in that reform
we were speaking of, but I haven't
much hope [<i>looking at Clara</i>]. There
is such a thing as total depravity. Oh,
here! [<i>taking package from under his
arm</i>]. What am I thinking of? I was
running away with your package [<i>hands
it to Clara</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> [<i>refusing it</i>]. Oh, but it's
yours, Mr. Hibbard. I couldn't think
of taking it. Really, you must keep it
to remember us by. Put it among your
art treasures at home, next to your lovely
illuminated manuscripts, and whenever
you look at it remember us and this delightful
evening, from which we are all
taking away so much. You must keep
it&mdash;that's part of the bargain, isn't it?
And now are we even?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Even? Far from it. I yield
you your woman's right to the last word,
and I admit it's the best [<i>stoops and
kisses her hand</i>]. Good-night, Clara.
[<i>To the reporter.</i>] May I give you a
lift back to town?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Thanks. As far as the
Hempsteds' corner. Good-night. Thank
you for this much help. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Thank goodness, they've
gone. What relief! That pace is too
rapid for me. You had me running
round in circles. But he's got the picture,
and we're safe at last. But don't
you think, Clara, you took some awful
risks. You goaded him pretty far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I had to. Did you hear him
call me Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>chuckling</i>]. He doesn't
know our name. But he wasn't a bad
fellow, was he? I couldn't help liking
him in spite of his impudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> You showed it. You took
sides with him against me all the time
the reporter was here. But, you know,
he was right about our house. It's all
wrong. The Hempsteds would see it
in a minute. I believe I'll clear out this
cabinet and have this room done over
in mahogany.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Too expensive this winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Birch will do just as well&mdash;nobody
knows the difference. Listen! is
he coming back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reporter</span> [<i>in the doorway</i>]. Excuse
me&mdash;listen. Mr. Hibbard says you've
given him the wrong package. He says
you need this to go with the picture of
your grandmother. And he says, sir,
that you need to get wise to your own
family. He's waiting for me. Good-night!
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. Get wise to my
own family? He may know all about
art [<i>undoing the picture</i>], but I guess I
know my own relatives. [<i>Holds up picture
so that audience can see it, but he
can't.</i>] And if that isn't a picture of
my own cousin Paul, I'll eat&mdash;[<i>sees
Clara laughing</i>]. What the devil!
[<i>Looks at picture, which represents
George Washington.</i>] Clara! you did
that! [<i>laughs uproariously</i>]. You little
cheat!</p>

<h2>THE MEDICINE SHOW</h2>
<p class="alignleft">A Comedy</p>
<p class="alignright">By Stuart Walker</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Prologue</span>: <i>This is only a quarter of
a play. Its faults are many. Come,
glory in them with us.</i></p>

<p><i>You are a little boy once more lying on
your rounded belly on the cool, damp
sands beside the beautiful river. You
are still young enough to see the wonder
that everywhere touches the world; and
men are in the world&mdash;all sorts of men.
But you can still look upon them with
the shining eyes of brotherhood. You
can still feel the mystery that is true understanding.
Everywhere about you men
and things are reaching for the infinite,
each in his own way, be it big or little,
be it the moon or a medicine show; and
you yourself are not yet decided whether
to reach for the stars or go a-fishing.
Brother!</i></p>

<p><i>Lut'er enters or rather oozes in.</i></p>

<p><i>He is a tall, expressionless, unco&ouml;rdinated
person who might be called filthy
were it not for the fact that the dirt on
his skin and on his clothes seems an inherent
part of him. He has a wan smile
that&mdash;what there is of it&mdash;is not displeasing.
Strangely enough, his face is
always smooth-shaven. He carries a
fishing pole made from a tree twig and
equipped with a thread knotted frequently
and a bent pin for hook.</i></p>

<p><i>Lut'er looks about and his eyes light
on the stone. He attempts to move it
with his bare foot to the water's edge,
but it is too heavy for him. Next he looks
at the log, raises his foot to move it,
then abandons the attempt because his
eyes rest on the lighter soap box. This
he puts in position, never deigning to
touch it with his hands. Then he sits
calmly and drawing a fishing worm from
the pocket of his shirt fastens it on the
pin-hook and casts his line into the water.
Thereafter he takes no apparent interest
in fishing.</i></p>

<p><i>After a moment Giz enters.</i></p>

<p><i>Giz is somewhat dirtier than Lut'er
but the dirt is less assimilated and consequently
less to be condoned. Besides
he is fuzzy with a beard of long standing.
He may have been shaved some Saturdays
ago&mdash;but quite ago.</i></p>

<p><i>Giz doesn't speak to Lut'er and Lut'er
doesn't speak to Giz, but Lut'er suggests
life by continued chewing and he acknowledges
the proximity of Giz by spitting
and wiping his lips with his hand. Giz
having tried the log and the rock finally
chooses the rock and acknowledges
Lut'er's salivary greeting by spitting also;
but he wipes his mouth on his sleeve.</i></p>

<p><i>After a moment he reaches forward
with his bare foot and touches the water.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> 'Tis warm as fresh milk.</p>

<p class="salute"><i>He is an eager, healthy-looking man
with a whitish beard that long
washing in Ohio River water has
turned yellowish. He wears spectacles
and his clothes and general
appearance are somewhat an improvement
upon Lut'er and Giz.
Furthermore he wears what were
shoes and both supports of his suspenders
are fairly intact. He is
whittling a piece of white pine with
a large jack-knife.</i></p>

<p class="salute"><i>Seeing Lut'er and Giz he draws the
log between them and sits.</i></p>

he didn't have no hen in his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> But the lady doctor said it
warn't so good&mdash;effie-cacious she called
it&mdash;withouten you took two bottles o'
the buildin' up medicine, a box o' the
liver pills an' a bottle o' the hair fluid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> She knowed a lot. She told me
just how I felt an' she said she hated to
trouble me but I had a internal ailment.
An' she said I needed all their medicine
jus' like the Indians used it. But I told
her I didn't have no money so she said
maybe the box o' liver pills would do if
I'd bring 'em some corn for their supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Y' got the liver pills?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> Uh-huh.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He punctuates his talk with covert

Giz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz</span> [<i>discouragingly</i>]. M' hip pocket.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Again they chew.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> The Family Medicine Book
where I learned ter be a doctor said
camphor an' ker'sene an' lard rubbed on

maybe. [<i>He looks at Giz.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> An' what ud cure tizic ought
ter cure anything, I think.... I'd 'a'
cured m' second wife if the winder hadn't
blowed out an' she got kivered with snow.
Atter that she jus' wheezed until she
couldn't wheeze no longer. An' so when
I went courtin' m' third wife, I took a
stitch in time an' told her about the
camphor an' ker'sene an' lard. [<i>Ruefully.</i>]
She's a tur'ble healthy woman.
[<i>His feelings and his curiosity having

fer a cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er</span>. What yer got, Giz? [<i>Calling
a man by name is a great effort for
Lut'er.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> Mostly a tired feelin' an' sometimes
a crick in th' back. [<i>Lut'er displays
a sympathy undreamed of.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> Gimme one, Giz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> Gosh! You want th' whole box,
don't yer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> Keep yer pills. [<i>He spits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> What's ailin' <i>you</i>, Lut'er?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> Oh, a tired feelin'. [<i>There is a
long moment of suspended animation, but
the Doctor knows that the mills of the
gods grind slowly&mdash;and he waits for
Lut'er to continue.</i>] An' a crick in m'
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I'll cure yer, Lut'er. [<i>Lut'er
just looks.</i>] If that Kickapoo doctor
with the p'inted muss-tash kin cure yer,
I guess I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz</span> [<i>who has been thinking pretty
hard</i>]. Got any terbaccer, Doc?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Yep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz</span>. Well, here's a pill fer a chaw.
[<i>He and the Doctor rise.</i>]</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Giz takes a pill out of the box and
the Doctor takes his tobacco from
his pocket, reaches out his hand
for the pill and holds out the tobacco,
placing his thumb definitely
on the plug so that Giz can bite off
so much and no more. Giz bites
and the Doctor takes over the pill.
Lut'er not to be outdone takes a
battered plug of tobacco from his
pocket and bites of an unlimited
"chaw." The Doctor takes his
knife from his pocket and cuts the
pill, smelling it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Ker'sene! [<i>He tastes it.</i>]
Ker'sene! Now I been thinkin' things
over, Lut'er and Giz.... [<i>He tastes the
pill again.</i>] Ker'sene, sure! [<i>He sits
down on the log once more, spits carefully
and crosses his legs.</i>] I got a business
proposition to make. [<i>Silence. Lut'er
spits and crosses his legs, and Giz just
spits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> There ain't enough home industry
here in Rock Springs. We got a
canning fact'ry and a stea'mill; but here
comes a medicine show from Ioway&mdash;a
Kickapoo Indian Medicine Show from
Ioway! Now&mdash;what we need in Rock
Springs is a medicine show! [<i>He waits
for the effect upon his audience.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. How yer goin'
ter git it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, here's my proposition.
Ain't we got as much horse sense as them
Ioway Indians?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> A damn sight more. [<i>That
is the evident answer to the Doctor, but
Lut'er develops a further idea.</i>] We got
the country from the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz</span> [<i>after a moment of accumulating
admiration</i>]. By Golly, Lut'er, yer
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Now, I got some medicine
science. I'd 'a' cured my second wife
if it hadn't been for that busted
winder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> Yeh, but what come o' yer first
wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> I could 'a' cured her, too, only
I hadn't found the Family Medicine Book
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> Well, what I wanter know is&mdash;what's
yer proposition.... I'm in a
hurry.... Here comes the Hattie
Brown.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Hattie Brown and the whistle
of the steam-mill indicate noon.

the fishing worm and puts it in his
pocket.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, I'll make the salve an'
do the talkin'; Giz'll sort o' whoop things
up a bit and Lut'er'll git cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> What'll I get cured of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Oh, lumbago an' tired feelin' ... crick in the back and tizic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> But who'll take a egg out o'
somebody's ear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Giz'll learn that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er</span> [<i>with a wan smile that memory
illuminates.</i>] An' who'll play the pianny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Besteena, my daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> Where we goin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> We'll go ter Lavanny first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> How'll we git there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span>  Walk&mdash;unless  somebody
give us a tote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> We kin go in my John-boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er</span>. Who'll row? [<i>There is fear
in his voice.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giz.</span> We'll take turns. [<i>Lut'er looks
with terror upon Giz.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lut'er.</span> How fur is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Three an' a half mile....

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Sitting room in the house of
Madame le Bargy. Furnished in excellent
taste. Main entrance center, this
leads into a hall. Another entrance left,
back. French window right near back,
near this stands a large wing chair.
Couch left, well forward. Chairs near
this. Nanette comes from the entrance
left as Monsieur Robert comes into the
room from entrance center. Nanette is
a European old maid. Her dark eyes are
full of fire and her lips are bitter. She
speaks quickly and sharply and is always
on the defensive. Monsieur Robert is
well groomed, gentle, weak and likable.
Nanette is in deep mourning. Monsieur
Robert carries a small bunch of flowers
which he holds awkwardly and fussily as
if they embarrassed him.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Monsieur Robert....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Nanette.... How are you, Nanette! You look
thinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, it's the mourning. It's
unbecoming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> I shouldn't say that, Nanette.
How is Madame? Tell me. [<i>Nanette
gives an eloquent shrug.</i>] I haven't dared
to come before. You know how I hate
anything&mdash;anything like a scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>sitting left</i>]. Sit down,
Monsieur Robert. [<i>He sits in a chair
forward right.</i>] It was cowardly of you
not to come to see Madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, I know. I am such a
coward. I cannot imagine how I came
to be such a coward, Nanette. I am
afraid to do anything any more. Yet my
mind keeps so active. How do you account
for that? It's my imagination.
It seems to run ahead and do things in
my place. In these times I am all over
the world at once. Nanette, will you believe
it, that I suffer actually with every
man in the trenches?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. Oh, I
daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You don't understand my
case. I am fifty-five. I have lived for
my work always. Why should I give it
up now that the world has gone mad?
Some one must stay behind and keep
things together. Some one must conduct
the dull march of everyday life. We
can't all be heroes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Your work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Well, to be at the head of a
big charity. That is something. Countless
lives, numberless families are in my
care. I am sort of a father to them all,
Nanette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> They could have a mother
as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>with pained eagerness</i>]. Do
you really think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I know it. There are many
women as well fitted for your post as
you&mdash;better fitted, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Oh, surely not. I have had
the experience of years. I love my work
so. I love my little people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You have made a pleasure
out of what should be only your duty.
It isn't the poor who couldn't get along
without you, Monsieur Robert. It's you
who couldn't get along without the poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Well, are we all to live merely
to do our duty? Is that what the Germans
are going to teach us&mdash;to be machines
like themselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I suppose after all, you are
better off where you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> How do you mean, Nanette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You are more of a woman
than a man after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You were always bitter
against me, Nanette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You were always superior
with me, because I was not beautiful like
Madame nor young like Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> How did you say she was,
Nanette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You will find her greatly
changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> I wanted to come to her as
soon as she came, from Aix les Bains.
When she went to recover the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>in a tone of deep feeling</i>].
Yes, when we went hoping to find Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>softly</i>]. Tell me about his
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> There were terrible days in
which we could learn nothing certain.
Several times they gave up hope. What
hope! It only made certainty more unbearable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> They found him at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, they found Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> The French. That was good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> No, the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> But Madame wrote me....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> That was a lie she told you.
The Germans found him. It was they
who had the privilege of putting him
away to his final rest. He had just won
his cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> He won the cross!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, didn't you hear? That
very week. [<i>Almost overcome with emotion
she rises.</i>] We have it now. [<i>She
goes out back a moment and returns with
a small black box which she opens reverently.</i>]
Here is all that we have left of
Maurice. [<i>She hands him a picture post
card.</i>] This was taken only the day before....
[<i>She hands him a letter.</i>]
This was the last letter ... you can see
the date.... He was never so confident
or full of life.... There is even a joke
about me. He was always making fun
of me. I don't know why. [<i>She hands
him a revolver.</i>] Here is his revolver.
[<i>She takes out the small box with the
cross of war and hesitates to give it to
him.</i>] This&mdash;this is what we have left
in place of Maurice. [<i>With a violent look
she opens the box and then suddenly
hands it to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You mustn't look on it in
that way, Nanette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I can't help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>reading</i>]. Maurice Paul le
Bargy. Little Maurice! He was never
meant for action either. Do you remember
how we used to tease him? He hated
to make any decision. He loved life's
dreams and nuances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> He was nothing but a
dreamer. Madame and I were talking
only yesterday of his garden&mdash;did we
ever tell you of the garden he had when
he was a boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>handing her the box very carefully</i>].
No. Tell me about the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> He made himself a garden,
everything in it was arranged as if for
people only an inch high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> But there are no such people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Of course not. That is
why every one made fun of him. But he
went on building it just the same. It
was scaled so that he was a giant in it.
There were little houses and little walks
and little boats sailing on lakes two feet
across. The geraniums were great trees,
his pet turtle was like a prehistoric monster,
and the hollyhocks pierced heaven
itself. When people told him that no one
could really enjoy such a garden he said
that the ants could, and they ought to appreciate
a little beauty because they were
always so busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> That was like Maurice. How
vast the sky must have seemed to him
who loved minute shadowy things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> He was always timid.
Everything violent frightened him. They
made him positively ill. And how he
dreaded the sea! Do you remember how
Madame tried to get him to swim?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> But he did learn to swim
finally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes. But he told me one
day&mdash;"Nanette, when I hear the surf
my whole body shakes with fear. I feel
as if some terrible giant were calling me.
I hate the great sea."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> And he fell into the sea, didn't
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Two thousand feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> What he must have endured
all alone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> No one can know.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>After a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You say Madame has
changed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>looking toward left before
speaking</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Why do you look around like
that? Is there anything wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, there is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> What do you mean? Is
Madame very ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> There has been a change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> What kind of a change?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Madame has changed. You
wouldn't know her, Monsieur Robert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You mean she has grown old?
Madame was always so beautiful. Has
her hair turned white?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> No, it isn't that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> You mean she is so stricken
she can't talk with me? She won't see
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> She will see you. But for
your own peace of mind I advise you to
go away. I will tell her that you came.
That will be the best way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> A change, you say? You
mean she has altered so....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes. The truth is, it is
Madame's mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Her mind! No, no, don't tell
me that. That is the worst of all. Do
you mean that she is not clear in her
mind? She wouldn't know me? She
wouldn't be able to remember? Nanette,
I can't believe it. I can't believe that this
great and beautiful woman could give
in like that. Everywhere you see the
small ones breaking down. But the great
spirits like hers&mdash;oh they must keep up.
What else is there left for us if they
give up, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> If you could hear her talk,
Monsieur Robert. The things she says....
Sometimes I have to run away
and lock my door. I am afraid of
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> I cannot stay now, Nanette.
I couldn't bear it. It was hard enough
for me before. What can I say to her,
Nanette, when my own grief finds no comfort?
Maurice was like my own son.
He was the fruit of my own soul. Into
him went all the spiritual love I had for
Madame, the love which for fourteen
years....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Monsieur Robert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Oh, Nanette, forget your
piety for once and let me speak my heart
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>with her strange, bitter coldness</i>].
No, Monsieur Robert, I can never
forget what you call my&mdash;piety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> No, you never can. That is
why I have never been able to talk to
you. Your heart is closed to all but
Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, that is true. My heart
has been like one of those vases of domestic
use which the ancients buried with
the dead in their tombs. All that was
warm and beautiful in me is closed away
forever with Maurice. Although I was
never more to him than a familiar object
which was a part of his everyday life.
Only his old nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> How did he come to inspire
such love in every one who came near
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Because he was young and
beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> But that is simply a temporary
state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Maurice would always have
been young and beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, he made you believe
that. When he talked with you you felt
glad and young as if you'd heard music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> He loved life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yet he was a coward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> But he always dared to do
what he was afraid to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, that is where he was different
from me. That is what I have
never been able to do&mdash;to dare as far
as I could imagine.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes slowly toward the back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>rising</i>]. You are going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes. I can't see her. You
see the state I am in. What could I say
to her? I had better go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, it is the best way for
you both.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Robert hesitates at the chair right.
He tentatively puts a hand out to

it curiously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>unsteadily</i>]. What are you
doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> It is strange.... [<i>Suddenly
he falls into the chair and buries his head
in the cushions, sobbing and calling.</i>]
Maurice! Maurice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>hoarsely</i>]. Monsieur Robert.
[<i>As he does not answer&mdash;sharply
and frightened.</i>] Monsieur Robert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span> [<i>rises slowly, a little dazed, but
calm</i>]. Yes, yes, I know. I am trying
your nerves. Forgive me. I am going
now, Nanette. Here&mdash;I was forgetting&mdash;The
flowers I brought for Madame.
You will give them to her, Nanette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Monsieur Robert, why did
you act in that way just now? Why did
you go to that chair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> When we came home from
Aix les Bains I thought Madame would
go wild. She tore her clothes. She went
striding about the house from room to
room calling at the top of her voice&mdash;Maurice,
Maurice. She went into all the
rooms, into his room, looking into the
closets&mdash;everywhere&mdash;Then she came
running down here. She went back into
the back sitting room where she is now&mdash;then
back into this room. At last she
came to that chair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> To that chair, Nanette? Are
you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> To that very chair. Then
she flung herself down into it and cried.
That was the first time she had cried.
I went away. When I came back she was
still there. And then this strange and
terrible change came over her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> A peculiar quiet, an awful
calm like death&mdash;only more terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, that is how I felt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Just now in that chair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> A calm, you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> Yes, like a hand pressed over
my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> But you seemed happier,
Monsieur Robert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert.</span> I am happier, Nanette. [<i>He
goes toward back.</i>] I am going.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes out at center. Nanette

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Does Madame le Bargy live

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, she does. Where can
Julie be? Did the maid let you in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> No, the gentleman who just
went out ... he left the door open

you are mistaken in the Madame le
Bargy ... this is Madame Jeanne le
Bargy&mdash;the writer....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Yes, yes, I know. Mightn't I
speak with her for a moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> That is impossible. Since
the death of her son Madame le Bargy
has seen no one. No one at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> I might have known. Let me
think. My mind has been so confused
lately. I have been in such a state of
mind&mdash;I don't know what to do. I came
running here without any idea in my
head. I felt that I would be all right if
I could only see Madame le Bargy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>tersely</i>]. Perhaps Mademoiselle
had better see the doctor. At the
end of the street&mdash;number 27&mdash;you will
find an excellent physician.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> No physician on earth can
cure me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>after giving her an uneasy,
distrustful look</i>]. Well, since you cannot
see Madame le Bargy, and since you
have no message for her, I must ask you
please to excuse me. I am busy.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She stands waiting for Diane to go,

now that the things which seem so simple

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Mademoiselle&mdash;are you&mdash;Nanette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>who seems to grow small

call me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> He often spoke of you. He
told me of you. You were his old nurse.
You were very dear to him. He always
said he was the only person to reach
your heart. [<i>Seizing Nanette's hand.</i>]
Nanette! Let me call you Nanette! Let
me touch you. Let me know that heart
which he could waken. I am so in need
of help. I am so in need of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>drawing away</i>]. Mademoiselle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> You have lost Maurice. You
know what I feel. Only you can know.
Help me. Let us help each other! We
can never be strangers for our hearts
bear the same sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I don't understand. [<i>Growing
stern with the realization.</i>] Maurice!
Can it be that Maurice.... No, that is
impossible. He was not like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Nanette. I loved Maurice.
He loved me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>recoiling as if at a great obscenity</i>].
Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Why do you speak like that?
What could there be in our love for each
other that was wrong? If you only knew
what we were to each other. If you only
knew, Nanette....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>hoarsely</i>]. Maurice.... I
can scarcely believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Let me talk to you about him.
Let me tell you about us. [<i>She sits on
the couch left, and feverishly begins to
talk.</i>] I am an actress. We met at a
supper party after the theater. You
know how shy Maurice was. He was
afraid of most people. I saw that. I
drew him to one side and got him to talk.
He was like a child when any one took a
real interest in him. He told me all
about himself at once, about you, and
about Madame le Bargy....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>passionately</i>]. Oh, keep
still!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>not noticing Nanette's hostility</i>].
And about your house in the country,
and his garden and books and his
piano and all the things he loved. Then
he went on and told me about his work,
and how he wanted to be a great writer,
how he wanted to carry on what was best
in the French theater. He promised to
show me his play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> His play!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> I told him to come to my house
and read it to me. He came the next
day. It was the twenty-first of March.
I remember the date perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> We always left town on that
day, but we could not get Maurice to go,
so we had to leave him behind. Now I
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Yes. He stayed to lunch with
me, and that afternoon I had him read his
play to me. Do you remember how beautiful
his voice was? It started in a sort
of sing song, like a child singing itself
to sleep, but as he went on his voice grew
deeper and stronger, all your senses
melted into his voice and he carried you
along as if on a great wave of emotion,
of ecstasy. Monsieur Laugier came
later. He was my manager then. I had
Maurice read the play to him. And later
some other people came, and every one
urged Monsieur Laugier to take the play.
I begged him to read it. I will never
forget it. It seemed to me the most important
thing in the world. Well, as you
know, Monsieur Laugier did produce
Maurice's play. And, although they
wouldn't let me be in it, I always considered
it my play, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Then the story he told us
of his meeting with Monsieur Laugier&mdash;that
wasn't true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> No. I invented that for him
to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> He lied to us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> You would never have understood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Let me think&mdash;Maurice's
play was produced in September, 1913.
That is two years ago. Two years....
Maurice lived here with us&mdash;day after
day&mdash;saying nothing&mdash;telling us nothing&mdash;We
never suspected. We never
dreamed that he would deceive us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> He did not deceive you. Not
even the closest hearts can reveal everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> But to continue to see you
... all that time! It is unthinkable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> How could he explain what he
didn't understand himself? How could
he tell you of what was a mystery to him?
From the first moment we met we lived
and thought and felt as one being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>vehemently</i>]. No! With us
he was like that! He was like that with
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> With me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> To think of it! A common
actress!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. How could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> If I had known of this affair
I would have gone straight to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> And what could you have
done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>significantly</i>]. I could have
found a way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> You are a terrible old woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Am I terrible? I had to
fight my way when I was your age&mdash;because
I was not pretty. I had the
choice of being a free drudge or some
man's slave. So I chose to toil alone. In
order to get along alone I had to stifle
every drop of humanity in my being. I
had to bind up my human instincts as
they bind up the breasts of mothers who
flow too bounteously with life-blood long
after their babes have need of it. I had
to become sharp and bitter because sweetness
and softness get crushed under in
the battle to live. I learned to fight and
I forgot to feel. Then, when I was used
up and hard I met Madame le Bargy and
she took me into her house because I had
one valuable thing left. I had learned
that it is wiser to be honest. I was there
when Maurice was born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> You were with him from the
very beginning then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I was an old maid of thirty-five.
I had always lived alone. I hadn't
ever had a dog to care for. Then all at
once I had this baby, this little baby. I
had his baby cries to call me. I had his
tiny hands to kiss. I used to press my
lips against his throbbing head, against
the soft fissure where life and death meet,
and I would say to myself, "Here, with
one pressure I can crush away life.
Here, with one pressure is where immortal
life must have entered."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Then later&mdash;when he grew
up....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Day by day I watched over
him. Madame was busy. Even after her
husband died she was in the world. She
had her writing. She had her friends.
Her heart was fed in a hundred different
ways. While I&mdash;I had only Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I lived only for Maurice.
When I saw that it was raining I thought
of Maurice. When I saw that the sun
shone I thought of Maurice. If I was
awakened suddenly in the night his name
was on my lips. It seemed to me I could
not take a deep breath for fear of disturbing
his image against my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Nanette! Can you believe
that I have felt that way too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Yes, yes, I have. Nanette,
when he was little, when he was a boy
growing up, did you never think of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Yes, of the woman who would
eventually take your place. Didn't you
think of what she would be like, didn't
you plan her, didn't you pray that she
might be fine and great and beautiful?
I know you did. You must have! Well,
I tried to mold myself that way. I
tried to be worthy of every dream you
could have had for him, that his mother
could have had. That is how I loved
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Do you know what I thought
of when the idea of a woman for Maurice
came into my mind? I thought that
when she came&mdash;if she ever did&mdash;</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She pauses, looking ahead of her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>turning and looking at Diane
vindictively</i>]. I would kill her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Nanette, I would have killed
myself rather than harm Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'They'">Then</ins> why did you allow
him to throw himself away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Throw himself away! Nanette,
I never knew what love was until
Maurice came. I was older than he. I
knew life better. I knew myself better.
I had struggled. You say that you had
to struggle because you weren't pretty.
I had to struggle because I was. You
can't know what it is to have every other
man you meet want to possess you, not
because he loves you, but because your
face suggests love to him and he hasn't
learned to know the difference. He finds
that out later, and then he reproaches
you for being beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> To think that Maurice
should fall so low!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> But I came to know things. I
was determined to find love. From man
to man, Nanette, I climbed up and up,
picking my way, falling and getting up
again. Only the truly educated can love.
I loved Maurice with all the wisdom I
had accumulated in years of suffering.
I gave him a perfect gift I had molded
in pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> You! What had <i>you</i> to
give?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Then the war broke out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Yes, the war. Maurice was
one of the first. He made up his mind
at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> No, he did <i>not</i> make up his
mind at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>with a dreadful realization</i>].
Then it was....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> I made up his mind for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>vehemently</i>]. You did it!
It was you then! You sent Maurice to
war. After they excused him! After
they gave him a post at home! You sent
him to his death. Oh, I hated you before,
but now....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> His mother and you clung to
him. There was one excuse after the
other. You made him believe that he
was too delicate and sensitive. You used
all of your influence. Madame le Bargy
tried in every way to keep him. She
even testified officially that Maurice was
weak from birth and had dizzy spells
and an unaccountable fear of the sea.
And you testified under oath to a long
and dangerous illness he had had in
childhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I did that. And it was all
a lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> But all the time I was urging
him to go. We three women fought for
mastery. But you see who won! I did!
When he came to me at nights&mdash;in the
country&mdash;to my little house where we
had been so happy, there, there, in the
very room where we were nearest, then
I persuaded him. With my kisses, Nanette,
with my arms, with all the power
I had over him&mdash;then was when I thrust
him away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>triumphantly</i>]. You didn't
love him then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>passionately</i>]. Could I love
Maurice and see him stay behind? Could
I really want him to save his body for
me when thousands were giving theirs
for France?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> For France.... But what
of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Oh, the selfishness of those
who have never really loved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Never loved! How can
you say that I have never loved?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> What can you know of my
loss? Your love was a habit. It was
the love you could have lavished on a
dog, or a horse or anything. But with
me&mdash;now that he is gone, I have lost
everything. I have no place to turn. I
haven't even memory, as you have. Your
love always took on the color of memory,
but mine was a living, flaming thing,
necessary as food and drink&mdash;as life itself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>white with passion</i>]. But
my love was pure and yours was not.
[<i>She crosses the room.</i>] Good God, to
think that this thing should ever have
happened to us in this house! [<i>She
covers her face with her hands and runs
out back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. After?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> How long did you
know Maurice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> It would be two years this
March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> You loved each
other all that time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> From the very first. We never
had any of those preliminaries in which
people have a chance to deceive each
other. We came together directly and
frankly and we never regretted it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Maurice was very
young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> He was twenty-four. He was
eager for life. But you two had kept
him back. You had warmed his heart
with your kind of love until he had begun
to think it was the only love which
is worthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> And you believe
that that isn't so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>simply</i>]. I believe that there
can be no flame like the love between
two young people who are one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>going to Diane and
putting a hand on her shoulder</i>]. Poor
little woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. Madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> You have been suffering
a great deal, Diane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>bursting into wild weeping</i>].
Oh, Madame, how good you are, how kind
you are! [<i>Grasping Madame's arms, she
trembles and sobs.</i>] Oh, how can I ever
tell you? Thank you, thank you! [<i>She
jumps up and paces about the room.</i>]
What am I going to do with myself?
How can I go on? I simply can't stand
it. If I had only died with Maurice!
If I could only have died in his place!
Oh, the cruelty of it! Why did they have
to pick out <i>my</i> lover? Surely there are
thousands of others. Why did it have
to be just mine? Mine&mdash;when I needed
him so! He might have been spared a
little longer, to give me time to get used
to it. That would have been better. But
now! Just as he was beginning to be of
service, too. Why he hadn't been there
a year yet. Not even a year! [<i>Beating
her hips violently.</i>] I could tear myself
to pieces. I hate myself for going on
living. I detest myself for being alive
when he is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>who has watched
Diane with infinite pity&mdash;softly</i>]. Diane,
do you think that I loved my son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>in surprise</i>]. Why, yes, Madame,
I believe that you loved Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> You think that my
love was not as great as yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> No, I don't think so. You had
had your life. Maurice and I were only
beginning ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Which do you
think is the greater love, Diane, the love
which endures for the moment, or the
love which endures for all time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. For all time...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> For all time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> We have the dear lips to kiss,
the dear head to caress, but when these
are gone there is only memory&mdash;and
that is torture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> What if I should
tell you that Maurice still lives, Diane?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>rushing to her</i>]. Madame!
My God, is this true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Maurice
still lives, Diane. He talks with me every
day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. He talks with you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>holding her gaze</i>].
Yes, Diane, he talks with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>the hope dies out of her face
and she turns away</i>]. I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> You see, you did
not love Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> How can you tell me that&mdash;that
I didn't love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Because you don't
continue to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> But how can I love what no
longer exists?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Oh, the selfishness
of those who have never really loved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> That is what I said to Nanette&mdash;and
now you say the same thing
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Diane, when I
knew for certain that Maurice had fallen
into the sea, that they had recovered his
body, that he was buried in German soil,
then I felt that I should never live another
moment. I felt as you have felt.
I wanted to die. I could not bear it.
I came here to this house. I was mad
for the sight of him, for the things that
he had touched and loved. I flew into
his room and dragged his clothes from
the pegs and crushed them to me, but
even the odor and touch of his personal
belongings was not enough to calm me.
I came into this room. Then I drew
near that chair. Something&mdash;I don't
know what&mdash;drove me to sit in it. I
flung myself into it as if it were into his
arms, and I wept out all my grief. Then,
all at once, a great calm came over me.
I looked upon my solemn black dress in
amazement and distaste. I looked into
my solemn and black heart with surprise
and shame. I felt that Maurice was <i>alive</i>,
that he was not <i>dead</i>, Diane. Then I remembered,
as I sat there, that it was in
this chair that he had sat when he came
to say good-by. There he had sat talking
happily and confidently&mdash;he had
seemed filled with radiance. And so he
has talked to me again and again. Every
day, at the same time, at twilight, I have
sat there and felt myself with Maurice.
We have talked together, just as we always
did. There is nothing weird or supernatural
about it, Diane. He is just as we
knew him, as we knew him in those swift,
strange moments when, in a flash, the
body seems to slip aside and spirit rushes
out to meet spirit. That is all. People
see me cheerful and smiling and they say
that I am mad. The few to whom I
have told of these talks pity me and are
sure that I have lost my reason. Perhaps,
in a worldly sense, I am mad. But
I know this, Diane, that Maurice lives as
usual, more truly, than he did six weeks
ago. I know that his youth has not been
sacrificed in vain. As the dead plant
enriches the soil from which it grew and
into which it finally falls, so will this
young soul in all its bloom enrich the life
out of which it sprang and from which
it can never entirely disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>after a pause&mdash;rising</i>]. That
is beautiful, but I cannot do it. [<i>Stretching
out her arms.</i>] My arms are aching
with emptiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> You see that you
did not really love, Diane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Perhaps not. But it was the
greatest I was capable of.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She gets a scarf she has dropped
and goes toward the back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>softly</i>]. This is the
time, Diane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> When you talk with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Diane goes slowly and sinks into the
chair wearily. Suddenly she flings
her arms out, crying "Maurice,
Maurice." Madame le Bargy rises
and goes to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane.</span> Maurice, come back to me!
Dear God, give him back to me!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Nanette enters at back with her
black box. She sees Diane in the
chair. Suddenly she takes out the
revolver and shoots Diane.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> Maurice! Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy.</span> Nanette! Child!
My child! [<i>She rushes to take Diane in
her arms.</i>] Nanette, what have you done,
what have you done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette.</span> I have rid Maurice of a
stain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diane</span> [<i>calling softly</i>]. Maurice, Maurice....
Oh, I knew you couldn't stay
away. I knew you would come back to
me. Now we will never be separated.
We will be together like this for always&mdash;for
all time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame le Bargy</span> [<i>softly</i>]. For all
time, Diane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nanette</span> [<i>kneeling beside Diane&mdash;crossing
herself</i>]. For all time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Yes, sir?</p>

overcoat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> I've put it in already, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Collars and ties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> I've looked out for everything,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. You sent
off the trunks this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> You're sure they can't be
traced?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> I had one wagon take them
to a vacant lot, and another wagon take
them to the station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> I checked them through to
Chicago. Here are the checks. [<i>He
hands them over.</i>] What train do we
take, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> <i>I</i> take the midnight.
You follow me some time next week.
We mustn't be seen leaving town together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> How will I find you in Chicago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> You won't. You'll take
rooms somewheres, and I'll take rooms
somewheres else till it's all blown over.
When I want you I'll put an ad in the
"Tribune."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> You don't know when that
will be, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> As soon as I think it is

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Yes?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes into the next room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson</span> [<i>waits an instant. Then he
lifts the telephone receiver, and speaks
very quietly</i>]. Hello. Murray Hill 3500....
Hello. This Finley? This is Benson....
He's going to take the midnight
train for Chicago. Pennsylvania. You
had better arrest him at the station. If
he once gets to Chicago you'll never find
him. And, Finley, you won't forget <i>me</i>,
will you?... I want five thousand dollars
for it. Yes, five thousand. That's
little enough. He's got almost three hundred
thousand on him, and you won't
turn in <i>all</i> of that to Headquarters. Yes,
it's cash. Large bills. [<i>Strickland's step
is heard.</i>] Midnight for Chicago.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Benson hangs up the receiver and is

enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Here's your money, Benson.
Count it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson</span> [<i>after counting</i>]. Six hundred

closed suitcase.</i>] Shall I go now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> No. Wait a minute.
[<i>He goes to the telephone.</i>] Hello, Madison
Square 7900 ... Pennsylvania? I
want a stateroom for Chicago, midnight
train. Yes, to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Don't give your own name,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> No. The name is Stevens....
Oh, you have one reserved in
that name already? Well, this is <i>Alfred</i>
Stevens.... You have it reserved in that
name? Then give me another stateroom....
What? You haven't any other?
[<i>He pauses in an instant's thought.
Then, decisively</i>]: Never mind, then.
Good-by. [<i>He turns to Benson.</i>] Benson,
go right down to the Pennsylvania,
and get the stateroom that is reserved
for Alfred Stevens. You've got to get
there before he does. Wait for me at
the train gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Don't waste any time.
I'll see you later.</p>

wait, and then the knock, a single knock,
is repeated. He rises, goes to the door,
opens it.</i>] Who's there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Girl.</span> I, sir.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She enters. She is young: certainly
under thirty: perhaps under twenty-five:
possibly still younger. A
somewhat shabby boa of some dark
fur encircles her neck, and makes
her pallid face stand out with
startling distinctness from beneath
a mass of lustrous brown hair.
And as she steps over the threshold
she gives a little shiver of comfort,
for it is cold outside, and her thin
shoulders have been shielded from
the driving snow by a threadbare
coat. She enters the warm room
gracefully, and little rivulets of
melted ice trickle to the floor from
her inadequate clothing. Her lips
are blue. Her hands tremble in
their worn white gloves. A seat
before a blazing fire, or perhaps, a
sip of some strong cordial&mdash;this
is what she needs. But Strickland
has no time for such things. He
greets her with a volley of questions.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Who, don't you remember
me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> I'm from the office, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> The office?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> <i>Your</i> office. I'm one of
your personal stenographers, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Oh. I suppose I didn't
recognize you on account of the hat.
What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> There were some letters
which came late this afternoon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>interrupting harshly</i>].
And you're bothering me with them now?
[<i>He crosses to the door, and holds it
open.]</i> I've got no time. Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. I thought you'd
want to see these letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Plenty of time to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> But you won't be here to-morrow,
will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>starting violently</i>].
Won't be here? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> You're taking the train to
Chicago to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> How did you know&mdash;[<i>He
stops himself. Then, with forced
ease.</i>] Taking a train to Chicago? Of
course not! What put that in your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Why, you told me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> <i>I</i> told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> You said so this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>harshly</i>]. I didn't see
you this afternoon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>without contradicting him</i>].
No, sir? [<i>She produces a time-table.</i>]
Then I found this time-table.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She holds it out. He snatches it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Where did you find it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> On your desk, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> On my desk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>suddenly and directly</i>].
You're lying!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Why, Mr. Strickland!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> That time-table never
reached my desk! I lost it between the
railroad station and my office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Did you, sir? But it's the
same time-table: you see, you checked
the midnight train. [<i>He looks at her
suspiciously.</i>] I reserved a stateroom
for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>astonished</i>]. You reserved
a stateroom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I knew you'd forget
it. You have your head so full of
other things. So I telephoned as soon
as you left the office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>biting his lip angrily</i>]. I
suppose you made the reservation in my
own name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>immensely surprised</i>].
What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> I thought you'd prefer
some other name: you didn't want your
trip to be known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> No, I didn't. [<i>A good
deal startled, he looks at her as if he
were about to ask, "How did you know
that?" She returns his gaze unflinchingly.
The question remains unasked.
But a sudden thought strikes him.</i>] What
name did you give?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Stevens, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>thunderstruck</i>]. Stevens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Alfred Stevens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>gasping</i>]. What made
you choose that name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> I don't know, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> You don't <i>know</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> No, sir. It was just the
first name that popped into my head. I
said "Stevens," and when the clerk asked
for the first name, I said "Alfred."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Have
you ever <i>known</i> anybody of that name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>with curious insistence</i>].
You are <i>sure</i> you never knew anybody
of that name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> How can I be sure? I may
have; I don't remember it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>abruptly</i>]. How old are
you? [<i>He gives her no time to answer.</i>]
You're not twenty, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Do you think
so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>continuing the current of
his thoughts</i>]. And I'm forty-seven. It
was more than twenty-five years ago....
You couldn't have known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>looking at her with something
of fear in his eye</i>]. What is your
name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Does it matter? You
didn't recognize my <i>face</i> a few minutes
ago; my <i>name</i> can't mean much to you.
I'm just one of the office force: I'm the
girl who answers when you push the
button three times. [<i>She opens a handbag.</i>]
These are the letters I brought
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>not offering to take them</i>].
What are they about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>opening the first</i>]. This is
from a woman who wants to invest some
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> How much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Only a thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Why didn't you turn it
over to the clerks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> The savings of a lifetime,
she writes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> What of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> She wrote that she had confidence
in you. She says that she wants
you to invest it for her yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> You shouldn't have bothered
me with that. [<i>He pauses.</i>] Did
she inclose the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Yes. A certified check.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>She hands it over to him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>taking the check, and putting
it in his pocketbook</i>]. Write her&mdash;oh,
you know what to write: that I will
give the matter my personal attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Yes, sir. She says she
doesn't want a big return on her investment.
She wants something that will be
perfectly safe, and she knows you will
take care of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Yes. Of course. What
else have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> A dozen other letters like
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> All from old women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>seriously</i>]. Some of them.
Here is one from a young man who has
saved a little money. He says that when
he gets a little more he's going to open a
store, and go into business for himself.
Here is another from a girl whose father
was an ironworker. He was killed accidentally,
and she wants you to invest the
insurance. Here is another from&mdash;but
they're all pretty much alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Why did you bring them
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Every one of these letters
asks you to do the investing yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> And you're leaving town
to-night. Here are the checks. [<i>She
passes them over.</i>] Every one of them
is made out to you personally; not to the
firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. You
shouldn't have come here.... I haven't
time to bother with that sort of thing.
Every man who has five dollars to invest
asks the head of the firm to attend to it
himself. It means nothing. I get hundreds
of letters like those.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Still&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> You must do something to
deserve such letters or they wouldn't
keep on coming in. [<i>She smiles.</i>] It's
a wonderful thing to inspire such confidence
in people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> It is more than wonderful!
It is magnificent! These people don't
know you from Adam. Not one in a
hundred has seen you: not one in a
thousand calls you by your first name.
But they've all heard of you: you're as
real to them as if you were a member of
their family. And what is even more
real than you is your reputation! Something
in which they rest their absolute
confidence: something in which they place
their implicit trust!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. So you think
there are few honest men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> No: there are many of
them. But there is something about you
that is different: something in the tone
of your voice: something in the way you
shake hands: something in the look of
your eye, that is reassuring. There is
never a doubt&mdash;never a question about
you. Oh, it's splendid! Simply splendid!
[<i>She pauses.</i>] What a satisfaction it
must be to you to walk along the street
and know that every one you meet must
say to himself, "There goes an honest
man!" It's been such an inspiration to
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> To <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Oh, I know that I'm just
one of the office force to you. You don't
even know my name. But you don't
imagine that any one can see you as I have
seen you, can work with you as I have
worked with you, without there being
<i>some</i> kind of an effect? You know, in
my own troubles&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>interrupting</i>]. So <i>you</i>
have troubles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> You don't pay me a very
big salary, and there are others whom I
must help. But I'm not complaining.
[<i>She smiles.</i>] I&mdash;I used to be like the
other girls. I used to watch the clock.
I used to count the hours and the minutes
till the day's work was over. But
it's different now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. How&mdash;different?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> I thought it over, and I
made up my mind that it wasn't right to
count the minutes you worked for an
honest man. [<i>Strickland turns away.</i>]
And there is a new pleasure in my work:
I do my best&mdash;that's all I can do, but
<i>you</i> do your best, and it's the <i>least</i> I can
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. Are you
sure&mdash;I do my best? Are you sure I
am an honest man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Don't you know it yourself,
Mr. Strickland?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>after another pause</i>].
You remember&mdash;a few minutes ago, you
spoke the name of Alfred Stevens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Suppose I told you that
there once <i>was</i> an Alfred Stevens? [<i>The
girl does not answer.</i>] Suppose I told
you that Stevens, whom I knew, stole
money&mdash;stole it when there was no excuse
for it&mdash;when he didn't need it. His
people had plenty, and they gave him
plenty. But the chance came, and he
couldn't resist the temptation.... He
was eighteen years old then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Only a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Only a boy, yes, but he
had the dishonest streak in him! Other
boys passed by the same opportunity.
Stevens didn't even know what to do
with the money when he had stolen it.
They caught him in less than twenty-four
hours. It was almost funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> He was punished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>nodding</i>]. He served a
year in jail. God! What a year! His
folks wouldn't do a thing for him: they
said such a thing had never happened in
the family. And they let him take the
consequences. [<i>He pauses.</i>] When he
got out&mdash;[<i>stopping to correct himself</i>]&mdash;when
he was <i>let</i> out, his family offered
him help. But he was too proud to accept
the help: it hadn't been offered when
he needed it most. He told his family
that he never wanted to see them again.
He changed his name so they couldn't
find him. He left his home town. He
came here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> And he has been honest
ever since!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Ever since: for twenty-eight
years! It was hard at times, terribly
hard! In the beginning, when he
had to go hungry and cold, when he saw
other men riding around in carriages, he
wondered if he hadn't made a mistake.
He had knocked about a good deal; he
had learnt a lot, and he wouldn't have
been caught so easily the second time. It
was <i>almost</i> worth taking the chance! It
was <i>almost</i> worth getting a foot of lead
pipe, and waiting in some dark street,
waiting, waiting for some sleek <i>honest</i>
man with his pockets full of money! It
would have been so simple! And he
knew <i>how</i>! I don't know why he didn't
do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Tell me more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> He managed to live. It
wasn't pleasant living. But he stayed
alive! I don't like to think of what he
did to stay alive: it was humiliating; it
was shameful, because he hadn't been
brought up to do that kind of thing, but
it was honest. Honest, and when he
walked home from his work at six o'clock,
walked home to save the nickel, his betters
never crowded him because they didn't
want to soil their clothes with his <i>honest</i>
dirt! He had thought the year in jail
was terrible. The first year he was free
was worse. He had never been hungry
in jail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Then his chance came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Yes, it <i>was</i> a chance.
He found a purse in the gutter, and he
returned it to the owner before he had
made up his mind whether to keep it or
not. So they said he was honest! He
knew he wasn't! He knew that he had
returned it because there was so much
money in it that he was afraid to keep it,
but he never told them that. And when
the man who owned the purse gave him
a job, he worked&mdash;worked because he
was afraid not to work&mdash;worked so that
he wouldn't have any time to think, because
he knew that if he began to think,
he would begin to steal! Then they said
he was a hard worker, and they promoted
him: they made him manager. That gave
him more chances to steal, but there were
so many men watching him, so many men
anxious for him to make a slip so that
they might climb over him, that he didn't
dare.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He pauses.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> The rest was easy. Nothing
succeeds like a good reputation, and
he didn't steal because he knew they'd
catch him. [<i>He pauses again.</i>] But he
wasn't honest at bottom! The rotten
streak was still there! After twenty-eight
years things began to be bad. He
speculated: lost all the money he could
call his own, and he made up his mind to
take other money that <i>wasn't</i> his own,
all he could lay his hands on, and run off
with it! It was wrong! It was the work
of a lifetime gone to hell! But it was the
rottenness in him coming to the surface!
It was the thief he thought dead coming
to life again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>after a pause</i>]. What a
pity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> He had been honest so
long&mdash;he had made other people think
that he was honest so long, that he had
made <i>himself</i> think that he was honest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl.</span> Was he wrong, Mr. Strickland?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>looking into her eyes;
very quietly</i>]. Stevens, please. [<i>There
is a long pause.</i>] I don't know what sent
you: who sent you: but you've come here
to-night as I am running away. You're
too late. You can't stop me. Not even
the finger of God Himself could stop
me! I've gone too far. [<i>He goes on
in a voice which is low, but terrible in its
earnestness.</i>] Here is money! [<i>He pulls
out his pocketbook.</i>] Hundreds of thousands
of it, not a cent of it mine! And
I'm stealing it, do you understand me?
<i>Stealing</i> it! To-morrow the firm will be
bankrupt, and there'll be a reward out
for me. [<i>He smiles grimly, and bows.</i>]
Here, if you please, is your honest man!
What have you to say to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>very quietly</i>]. The man
who has been honest so long that he has
made <i>himself</i> think that he is honest can't
steal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>hoarsely</i>]. You believe
<i>that</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>opening her bag again</i>]. I
was left a little money this week: only a
few hundred dollars, hardly enough to
bother you with. Will you take care of
it for me&mdash;Alfred Stevens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland.</span> Good God!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>And utterly unnerved he collapses
to a chair. There is a long pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Girl</span> [<i>crossing slowly to the window,
and drawing aside the curtain</i>].
Look! What a beautiful night! The
thousands of sleeping houses! The millions
of shining stars! And the lights
beneath! And in the distance, how the
stars and the lights meet! So that one
cannot say: "Here Gods ends; Here Man
begins."</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The telephone rings, harshly, and
shrilly. Strickland goes to the receiver.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strickland</span> [<i>quietly</i>]. Yes?... You're
afraid I'm going to miss the train?...
Yes? Well, I'm <i>going</i> to miss the train!...
I'm going to stay and face the music!
[<i>Hysterically.</i>] I'm an honest man, d'ye
hear me? I'm an honest man. [<i>And
furiously, he pitches the telephone to the
floor, and stands panting, shivering, on
the spot. From the window a soft radiance
beckons, and trembling in every limb,
putting out his hands as if to ward off
some unseen obstacle, he moves there
slowly.</i>] Did you hear what I told him?
I'm going to make good. I'm going to
face the music! Because I'm an honest
man! An honest man!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He gasps, stops abruptly, and in a
sudden panic-stricken movement,
tears the curtains down. The window
is closed&mdash;has never been
opened&mdash;but the girl has vanished.
And as Strickland, burying his face
in his hands, drops to his knees in
awe,</i></p>

<p>[<i>Night in a market place. A small
fire burns near a well. On a bench near
it sleeps the Beggar. The old Prostitute
is warming herself. There is the sound
of dogs barking in the distance. Vast
shadows move about the market-place.
The Drunkard emerges from the gloom
of the night.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Good evening, Madam
Prostitute. [<i>Listens to the dogs.</i>] Why
are the dogs whining like this to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> They must be seeing
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Yes, your black soul.
Perhaps they think you a devil. That's
why they chase all over the butchers'
stalls. No wonder. They've reason to
be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>in his sleep</i>]. He-he-he. Ha-ha-ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> A drunkard and a prostitute
are the same thing. None of us is
clean of sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>sleepily</i>]. Don't take me for
a "pal."</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Sleeps on.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Leave him alone. He
sings hymns the whole day long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> Poverty is no sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Don't mix in. [<i>To the
Prostitute.</i>] What do dogs see at night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> They say that on the first
of May the Holy Mother walks through
the market place, and gathers all the
stray souls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> What have the dogs got to
do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> They are people laden
with sins. People who died without the
Holy Sacrament, and who were buried
outside of the fence. At night they roam
about the market in the shape of dogs.
They run about in the stalls of the
butchers. The devil, too, stays there, but
when the first of May comes and the
prayers begin, the Holy Mother walks
through the market-place. The souls of
the damned cling to her dress, and she
takes them with her to Heaven.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Pause for a minute.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>turning in his sleep</i>]. Strong
vinegar bursts the cask. Her soul must
be black indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> It's awful to look into it.
You'll be among them yet....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> I'm not afraid of that.
The mercy of God is great. It will
reach even me. But all of you will be
among the dogs too. Those who live in
the street come back to the street after
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> The street is the home of the
beggar. Poverty is no sin.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Stretches himself and sleeps on.
There is a pause. The Fool comes
out of the darkness. He is tall,
with a vacant, good-humored face,
dressed in a soldier's hat, with a
wooden toy-sword in his girdle.
He grins kindly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Ah, good evening, Napoleon.
[<i>He salutes the Fool.</i>] Where do
you hail from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool</span> [<i>grins and chuckles</i>]. From Turkey.
I have driven out the Turk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> And where is your army?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool.</span> I have left it on the Vistula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> And when will you drive
the Russians out of there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool.</span> I have given my orders already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Are they being carried
out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool.</span> I only need to draw my sword.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Your sword?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool.</span> Napoleon gave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> Leave him be. Every one
is crazy in his way. [<i>To the fool.</i>] You
are cold. Come to the fire. He wanders
about the hollows the whole night long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool</span> [<i>smiles</i>]. I've quartered all of
my soldiers, but I have no place for myself
to sleep in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> A fool, and yet he knows
what he says. [<i>Gives him bread.</i>] Do
you want to eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool.</span> I get my dinner from the tables
of Kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>awaking</i>]. You've brought
the fool here too? He's got the whole
market place to be crazy in, and he comes
here, where honest people sleep.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Takes his stick and tries to reach
the Fool.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute</span> [<i>defending the Fool</i>].
Leave him alone I tell you. Crazy though
he be, he still wants to be among people.
Like aches for like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> Let him go to the graveyard,
and yell his craziness out among the
graves;&mdash;and not disturb honest men in
their sleep. The street is the beggar's
home, and I don't want to share it with
madmen. All that the people throw out
of their homes, wanders into the street.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He chases the Fool away, and lies
down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Who made you boss here?
The street belongs to all. Lie down in
the city hall, in the mayor's bed, if you
want to have rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> Keep still. He has a
right to the place. He's had it long
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> What kind of a right?
Are you a newcomer? How long have
you been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> All my life. I was born
in the street, there, behind the fence near
the church. My mother pointed out the
place to me. I have never known any
other home, but the street. In the daytime
it belongs to all. When people open
their shops, and peasants come in their
wagons, and trade begins, I feel a
stranger here, and I hide in the fields
near the cemetery. But when night
comes, and people retire into their holes,
then the street is mine. I know every
nook and corner of the market place.
It is my home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> You've said it well. In
that house there, I have a home, a bed,
and a wife. In the daytime I work there.
I sit among boots, and drive nails into
heels and soles. And I bear my wife's
nagging and cursing patiently.... But
when night comes I can't stand it any
longer. The house becomes too small for
me. Something draws me into the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> It is the curse of the street
that rests on you as it does on the howling
dogs. All of us are damned, and we
are punished here for our sins. And we
will not be delivered, till the Holy Mother
will come, and we will take hold of her
dress, and our souls will be freed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>in his sleep</i>]. He-he-he. Ha-ha-ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>becomes sad, bows his
head</i>]. In the daytime I don't mind it.
Then I am like other people. I work
like all do. But when night comes....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> It's the curse of the street.
Don't worry. God will pity all of us.
His mercy is great.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The cry of a child comes from the
distance. It resembles the howling
of a dog.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> That's Manka's bastard.
He strays the street. He wants to come
near the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Call him here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> Keep still. [<i>She points
to the Beggar.</i>] He will chase the boy
away. They believe the boy is born of
the Devil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Who made him boss here?
All of us are children of the Devil. [<i>He
calls to the boy as one calls to a dog.</i>]
Come here, you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>A dumb boy, all in rags, drags himself
near. He makes noises like a
little beast. He trembles with

him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> He lies the whole night
behind his mother's doorstep. She is
afraid of her husband. Sometimes she
gives him a piece of bread, when no one
looks. Thus he crawls like a worm in
the street&mdash;human flesh and blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Let him come near the fire&mdash;so.
[<i>He pushes the boy nearer to the
fire.</i>] Give him a piece of bread. I'll
take care of any one who tries to hurt
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar</span> [<i>awaking</i>]. No. That's too
much. Who brought this here? You
know that the Devil is in him?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tries to chase the boy away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute</span> [<i>hiding the boy in her

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> You're  the Devil's  wife.
That's why you pity his child.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Tries to reach the boy.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>tears the stick from the
Beggar's hand</i>]. We're all the children
of the Devil. You've no more on your
hide than he has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> Don't you start anything. I
am a Christian, and believe in God. I've
no home. That's why I sleep on the
street. Every dog finds his hole. But
I won't live together with the Devil. And
I won't be the neighbor of a harlot either.
Nor was a drunkard ever a friend of
mine. [<i>He gathers his belongings.</i>]
What are you running after me for?
This whole street belongs to the Devil.
Why are you trying to stop me?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He tries to go away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute</span> [<i>detaining him</i>]. Don't
leave us. Let him only warm himself.
He'll go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beggar.</span> It does me little honor to be
with folk like you anyway.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He goes away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Why do you hold him
back? Let him go if he thinks us below
his dignity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> And do you really think
it an honor for one to remain with you?
That man is decent at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> Ah, you grow pious as you
grow old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute.</span> I have always wanted to
be in decent company.</p>

It's awful to be with so many sick people.
Not one amongst them who is of
sound mind. Not one who has a clean

away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>with fear</i>]. The dogs have

Ah, the Fool. Well, how are your armies

Hold them in readiness. The Drunkard!

hand of Madame Prostitute. [<i>To the
Bastard</i>]: And your little heir is here

woman, and the children? Where did
you get them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Brother, this is not play. [<i>He

were locked in, and we have come out.
We are all one family&mdash;dogs. We wander
on the street. Men have shut their
doors in our faces. Come, dogs. We will
unite to-day. Throw off your chains, and
shake yourself as if you were shaking
dust from your shoulders. You are men
after all. I have known you from childhood.
I knew your mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>wondering</i>]. I don't know
what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Look at yourself. What have
they made of you? You walk the street
all night like an outcast. Your children
are afraid of you. They hide when they
see you drunk on the street, and weep
for you. Are you to blame for it? You
were made one with a mass of flesh you
hate. You sit bent over your boots the
whole day long, and curses and blows
are hurled at your head. And when night
comes you crawl in the gutter, and you
will crawl there till you will be freed
from shame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> What are you telling me
this for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> And are you to blame for this?
Have you had one minute of happiness
in your whole life? Who took care of
you? You were raised by your stepfather's
cane. Show me the scars on
your body. They beat you from childhood
on; first your stepfather, then your
"step-wife." No one ever spoke to you
as to a friend. No one ever comforted
you in your grief.</p>

brought him bread behind his stepfather's
back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard.</span> I will never drink again.

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>taking her hand</i>]. We will not
turn you, nor avoid you. We know what
you are. You are not to blame. Who
brought you up? Who was your mother?
You were born in the street like a goat.
Every stone, every hole in the earth
caresses you like a mother. You were
thrown into the street at birth, and men
ran from you as from a leper. Any wonder
that this is what became of you?
You lay in the street like an old, dirty
rag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prostitute</span> [<i>half-crying</i>]. I am not
worthy of such comforting words by a
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You are worthy. You are like
all of us. Your skin is dirty, but your
soul is clean. Wash your sins away,
throw the curse from off your shoulders,
and you will become a human being like
all of us. You too long for people. I
know you. You are good, you love humanity.
It is they who have cursed you
so. You were always a clean child.
Wait. Wait. [<i>He takes water from the
well, and pours it on her.</i>] I wash your
head, and you are a human being like
the rest of us. The curse is removed from
you. Look around yourself. Spring is
here. Its fragrance is everywhere. You
are a girl yet, a mere child. You know
no wickedness. You are in your father's
garden. Your mother sits near the window
and looks at you. You are walking
with your beloved.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>He takes the Drunkard, puts him
side by side with the Prostitute,

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> You are being married now.
Virgins come and bring you your bridal
dress, your veil, your myrtle wreath.

altar. Your mother lays her hand on
your head and blesses you. Sweet harp
music is heard. Your bridegroom takes
his place beside you.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Prostitute breaks out into
tears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>excited</i>]. I will be together
with her. I will defend her. I

sister. I will work for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> That's the way. The dogs
unite to-day. [<i>He takes the Bastard in
his arms and kisses him on the forehead.</i>]
And, he, too, is our child. All of us are
dogs of the street. All of us unite to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drunkard</span> [<i>takes the boy from the
Thief</i>]. He is our child. He will be with
us. [<i>He takes the arm of the Prostitute.</i>]
Come, we will go together. I will
work for you. You will bring him up,
and he will be our child. [<i>He takes the
shawl from the Prostitute, and wraps
himself and the boy in it.</i>] What? You
do not hear? Listen. I mean it with my
whole heart.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>The Prostitute does not hear. She
looks with awe at the Woman.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> That's the way. That's the
way. That's the way. To-day we unite.
We go together. We will be one with the
dogs. [<i>He caresses all he finds on the
street.</i>] Blow the trumpets, boys. Beat
the drums. We choose a queen to-day.
[<i>To the Fool.</i>] The army waits for you,
with swords in their hands, with spears
ready. Do you see the cannon all
trained? All wait for your command.
Do you see the foe around you? [<i>He
points to the street with a broad majestic
gesture.</i>] Here stands the army.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool</span> [<i>happily</i>]. Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief.</span> Give your order, Napoleon.
You are our general. Draw the sword,
and command!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fool</span> [<i>draws his wooden sword and
cries loudly as if he saw an army in the
market-place</i>]. Present arms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thief</span> [<i>loudly</i>]. That's the way. The
dogs unite to-day. All will unite. We
choose a queen to-day. [<i>He points to
the Woman.</i>] She is worthy of wearing
the crown of the street. Come, queen.
Mount to your throne. [<i>He bends his
back.</i>] Boys, blow your trumpets. Beat
your drums. At your knees. All hats
off. The queen comes. The queen comes.
So will we go to our land.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>It is grown lighter. The face of

beautiful, and begins to look like
the face of the Holy Mother.</i>]</p>

Oh, it is the holy picture before which

his shoulders, takes off his hat and kneels
with the rest. All prostrate themselves.
There is the sound of a church-bell. It
is day. From the open window of a house
across the way, leans out the wife of the
Drunkard, and yells.</i>] Ah, ah, what are
you doing there. Come into the house.
There is work to be done.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Workroom at Fanny Segal's.
A door to the left of the spectator, another
in the back. A large table, covered
with various materials; at each side of
the table a sewing machine. On the wall
to the right, a three-panelled mirror; in
the corner, a large wardrobe. Not far
from the wardrobe two dressmaker's
forms, covered with cloaks. In the middle
a broad armchair. Evening.</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>runs out through the rear door
and soon returns with a letter in her
hand. She tears it nervously open and is
absorbed in reading. Suddenly she gives
a scream of delight</i>]. Oh!&mdash;Oh! [<i>Passes
her hand over her face and through her
hair, looks at the letter, cries out anew,
breathing with difficulty. Looks at the
letter once more, and exclaims heavily.</i>]
You! My love! My love! [<i>She is lost
for a moment in thought, then calls.</i>]
Lizzie! Lizzie! Lizzie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>enters, dressed up as if for a
ball, sticking a pin in her hat. Mocks
Fanny's tone.</i>] What's up? What's up?
What's up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Read this! Quickly! It's
from Berman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>takes the letter</i>]. Why see!
We've just been talking about him. And
they really accepted his drama?</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Looks at the letter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>looks on, too, in great excitement</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>as she reads</i>]. That's fine!
[<i>Turns over a page and continues reading.</i>]
Why! This is an actual proposal
<ins class="correction" title="original reads 'if'">of</ins> marriage, Fanny, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>her breath short from delight</i>].
Did you understand it that way, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>still looking at the letter</i>].
How can it be interpreted otherwise?
[<i>About to read the letter aloud.</i>] Ahem!
[<i>Reads with a certain solemnity.</i>] "My
drama has been accepted and will be produced
this very winter. The conditions
of the contract are first-rate, and the
director promises me a great success,
and incidentally a great reputation."
[<i>Reads over some passages in an indistinct
nasal monotone, then continues.</i>]
"My! You ought to see me now.&mdash;I've
sung and danced so much that it'll be a
wonder to me if I'm not asked to move.
I feel so strong. And now to write, to
create, to do things!" [<i>Reads again in
a nasal monotone, and soon with greater
solemnity than before, and a certain tenderness.</i>]
"And now, I hope, better days
are in store for us, happiness of such a
nature that you cannot be indifferent to
it." [<i>Stops reading.</i>] That's a bit veiled,
but it's plain talk just the same. [<i>Gives
Fanny the letter. Speaks lovingly.</i>]
Lucky woman! My darling Fanny!
[<i>Embraces her.</i>] You dear! [<i>Kisses
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> So that's the way you understand
it, too? [<i>Speaks in gasps, trembling
all over.</i>] Oh! Oh!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Covers her face with the letter, takes
it to her lips and breathes with
difficulty. She takes from her right

her eyes.</i>]</p>

both arms</i>]. My dear Fanny! How
happy I am! You dear, you! [<i>Dreamily.</i>]
Now I know how I'll play at the
Ginsbergs' to-night! I'll put my whole
soul into the music, and it will be the
merriest, cheeriest soul that ever lived
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>bends down and kisses her

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> At last! My dream's come
true!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>drops into the armchair</i>].
Your dream?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>takes a piece of cloth from the
table, spreads it out on the floor, and
kneels before Fanny</i>]. Listen. I dreamed
for you a hero before whom the world,
even before seeing him, would bare its
head. I dreamed for you a triumphal
march of powerful harmonies, a genius,
a superman, such as only you deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Sh! Sh! Don't talk like
that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> No, no. You can't take that
away from me. As long as I shall live
I'll never cease admiring you. There
aren't many sisters in the world like you.
Why, you never have given a thought
to yourself, never a look, but have worked
with might and main to make a somebody
out of your sister. I'll tell you the truth.
I've often had the most unfriendly feelings
toward your sister Olga. She takes
it so easy there in Petrograd, while
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]. You're a naughty
girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> I simply couldn't see how
things went on,&mdash;how you were working
yourself to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> But that was my happiness,
and now I am amply repaid for it, to see
Olga placed upon an independent footing,
with a great future before her as a
painter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> That kind of happiness did not
appeal very much to me. I wanted, for
you, a different kind of happiness,&mdash;the
happiness of being a wife, of being a
mother, of loving and being loved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>in a reverie</i>]. I had already
weaned my thoughts away from love and
family life as the only happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> You poor soul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> When my mother died, my
road was clearly mapped out for me: to
be to my sister, who is eight years
younger than I, both a father and a
mother. That purpose was great and
holy to me. I never thought of anything
else. Only in the early twenties, between
twenty-two and twenty-five, a longing
for something else came to me. Not
that my sister became a burden to me,
God forbid, but I wanted something more,
a full life, happiness and&mdash;love. At that
time I used to cry very much, and wet
my pillow with my tears, and I was very
unhappy. And I was easily angered
then, too, so you see I was far from an
angel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>draws Fanny nearer, and kisses
her</i>]. You darling, you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> But later the longing left
me, as if it had been charmed away.
Olga grew older, and her talents began
to ripen. Then I forgot myself altogether,
and she became again my sole
concern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> And is that all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> What else can there be? Of
course, when my sister went to Petrograd
she was no longer under my immediate
care and I was left all alone. The old
longing re-awoke in my bosom but I told
myself that one of my years had no right
to expect happiness and love? So I determined
to tear out, to uproot from my
heart every longing. I tried to convince
myself that my goal in life had already
been attained&mdash;that I had placed a helpless
child securely upon her feet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> But you loved Berman all the
time, didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Yes, I loved him all the time,
but I fought my feelings. Life had
taught me to restrain and to suppress
my desires. I argued: He is too far
above me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> Too far above you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>continuing</i>]. And I am too
worn-out for him. And furthermore, I
tried to make myself believe that his
daily visits here were accidental, that
they were not intended for me at all, but
for his friend and nephew Hindes, who
happens to board with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> But how could you help perceiving
that he was something more than
indifference to you? You must have
been able to read it in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Well, you see how
it is! And perhaps for the very reason
that I had abandoned all ideas of love,
and had sought to deceive myself into
believing that I was a dried-up twig on
the tree of live&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. My! How you
sinned against yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>rising</i>]. But now the sap and
the strength flow again within me,&mdash;now
I am young once more.&mdash;Ah! Life, life!&mdash;To
enjoy it, to drink it down in copious
draughts, to feel it in every pulse-beat&mdash;Oh,
Lizzie, play me a triumphal
march, a song of joy, of jubilation....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> So that the very walls will
dance and the heavens join in the chorus.
[<i>Goes to the door at the left, singing.</i>]
"Joy, thou goddess, fair, immortal,
daughter of Elysium, Mad with rapture&mdash;"
[<i>Suddenly stops.</i>] Sh! Hindes

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>she has been standing as if entranced;

say a word to him about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> I will! He must know it, he
must be happy over it, too. And if he
truly loves you, he will be happy to
learn it. And then, once for all he'll get
rid of his notions about winning you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Don't be so inconsiderate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> Leave it to me!... Hindes!

won't you! Fa&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> May I at least sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie</span> [<i>loudly</i>]. Fanny has received
a letter from Berman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>taking a seat</i>]. Saying that
his drama has been accepted. I, too,
have received a letter from Berman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> That's nothing. The point is
that he is seeking to make a match with
her. He has practically proposed to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>astonished</i>]. Practically proposed?
To Fanny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lizzie.</span> Yes, and when Fanny comes
back you just see to it that you wish her
a right friendly congratulation, and that
you make no&mdash;[<i>Stops suddenly.</i>] Hm!
I came near saying something silly.&mdash;Oh,
I'm so happy, and I'd just have the whole
world happy with me. Do you hear?
You must help her celebrate, do you
hear? And now, good night to you, for
I must run along to the Ginsbergs'.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Turns to the door at the left singing:

Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> I'm going to my room, so you

as you always were. [<i>In a lower tone,
embarrassed.</i>] And be good to Berman.
For you know, between us, between you
and me, there could never have been anything
more than friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> There is no need of your telling
me that. I know what I know and
have no fault to find with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Then why are you so upset,
and why do you reproach yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Because....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Because what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>after an inner struggle, stormily</i>].
Because I am in a rage! To think
of a chap writing such a veiled, ambiguous,
absolutely botched sentence, and
cooking up such a mess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> What do you mean by all
this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> You know, Miss Segal, what
my feelings are toward you, and you
know that I wish you all happiness. I
assure you that I would bury deep within
me all my grief and all my longing, and
would rejoice with a full heart&mdash;if things
were as you understood them from Berman's
letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> As I understood them from
Berman's letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> &mdash;And what rouses my anger
and makes me hesitate is that it should
have had to happen to you and that I
must be the surgeon to cut the cataract
from your eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>astounded</i>]. Drop your rhetorical
figures. End your work. Cut
away, since you've begun the cutting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>without looking at her, deeply

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Not me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Not you, but your sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>with an outcry</i>]. Oh!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> He writes me that his first

him,&mdash;that gradually he was inflamed by
a fiery passion, and that he hopes his
love is returned, that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>falls upon a chair, her face

have good reason to weep, but not to

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>hysterically</i>]. She has taken
from me everything! My ambition to
study, my youth, my fondest hopes, and
now....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> And now?&mdash;Nothing. As
you see, Berman never loved you. If it
hadn't been for that unfortunate, ambiguous,
absolutely botched, simply idiotic
sentence....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>softly</i>]. Hindes, I feel that I
no longer care to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Folly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> I feel as if my heart had
been torn in two. My soul is empty,
desolate ... as if an abyss had opened
before me.... What have I now in life
for? I can live no longer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Folly! Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> I have already lived my life....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Absurd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>resolutely</i>]. I know what I'm
talking about, and I know what to do.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>regarding her closely. With
blunt emphasis</i>]. You're thinking now
over what death you shall choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>motionless</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>taking a seat</i>]. Let me tell
you a story. There was once upon a
time a man who&mdash;not through doubt and
misfortune, but rather through good times
and pleasures, came to the conclusion that
life wasn't worth living. So he went off
to buy a revolver. On his way a great
clamor arose in the street. A house had
caught fire and in a moment was in
flames. Suddenly, at one of the windows
in the top story there appeared a woman.
The firemen had placed their highest ladders
against the building and a man
began to climb up. That man was none
other than our candidate for suicide. He
took the woman out of the window, gave
her to the firemen who had followed him
up, and then went through the window
into the house. The surrounding crowd
trembled with fear lest the house should
cave in at the very last moment. Flames
already appeared at the window, and
people were sure that the hero had been
burned to death inside. But he had not
been burned; he soon appeared on the
roof, with a small child in his arms. The
ladders could not reach to this height,
so the firemen threw him a rope. He
tied the rope about the child and lowered
it to the firemen. But he himself was
beyond rescue. He folded his hands over
his heart, and tears trickled from his
eyes. He, who but a moment before had
sought death, now desired not to die.
No, he wanted to live, for in that moment
he had found a purpose: to live
and to do good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. To do good! I'm
tired of doing good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Don't sin against yourself,
Fanny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Do good! I have done good;
I have lived for others, not myself; and
now you can see for yourself that I have
not fulfilled my life. I feel as wretched
as the most miserable, as the most wicked,
and I long for death even as the most
unhappy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>looking at her from under his
spectacles</i>]. Does Olga know of your
feelings toward Berman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. I don't know what
she knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Can't you give me any better
reply than that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> What can I know? I used to
write her letters just full of Berman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Could Olga have gathered
from them that you were not indifferently
disposed toward him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> What do you mean by this
cross-examination?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> I have a notion that if you
were to do what you have in your mind
at present,&mdash;a thing I cannot bring myself
to name,&mdash;then Olga would not accept
Berman's love. Rather she would
take her own life, since she would
look upon herself as the cause of your
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> What's this you've thought
up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Just what you heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> And you mean&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> &mdash;That you know your sister
and ought to realize what she's liable to
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>in a fit of anger</i>]. First she
takes away my life, and now she will
not let me die!</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Her head sinks to the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> There spoke the true Fanny,
the Fanny of yore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>weeps bitterly</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Well may you weep. Weep,
Fanny, weep until the tears come no
more. But when that is over, then dry
your eyes and never weep again. Dry
forever the source of all your tears.
That's exactly what I did, do you understand?
Such people as you and I, robbed
of personal happiness, must either weep
forever, or never weep at all. I chose
the latter course. Harden yourself,
Fanny, and then fold your arms on your
breast and look fearlessly forward into
life, fulfilling it as your heart dictates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>continues weeping</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>noticing Berman's letter on
the table, takes it up and throws it down
angrily</i>]. Such a botched, idiotic sentence!
And he's a poet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>raising her head</i>]. If things
are as you say, then Olga will in any
case reject Berman. She will imagine
that she is taking him away from me, and
such a thing she would never do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Perhaps. [<i>Suddenly, bluntly.</i>]
And what will be the effect of all
this upon you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. Who's thinking of
self? I mean that I want her to have
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> There's the old Fanny again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Ah! Enough of that! Better
help me with some suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Some suggestion? Be her
matchmaker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> And suppose she should turn
the tables and want to be my matchmaker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> We've got to think that over.</p>

<p class="salute">[<i>Silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. Hindes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> I have an idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> But I need your aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Count on me, if I'm able.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Do you promise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Blindly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Blindly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>looks at her</i>]. Why must I
promise you blindly? If I'm able, you
may be sure I'll help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>brokenly, yet in embarrassment</i>].
Take me.... Marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>for a moment he looks at her,
then picks up his crutch, his books and
the packages</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>beseechingly</i>]. Hindes! If I
should marry, Olga wouldn't have any
obstacle in her way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Miss Segal, I have loved you,
and still do. But I refuse to be the altar
upon which you shall sacrifice yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> But a moment ago you dissuaded
me from death. Will you now
drive me back to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Your sister will be able to
find happiness without Berman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> But if she loves him?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Then she'll suffer, just as we
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> No! Olga must not suffer!
Do you hear! I'll not have it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> That is very nice of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>through her tears</i>]. Hindes,
I no longer know you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>turns toward the door</i>]. Good

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>limps to the door, then stops.
Looks downwards, then raises his eyes

that during all the time that I have
boarded with you I have made no declaration
of love, that I have never proposed
marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> I'll tell you. Wasn't it because
I knew that you didn't love me, and
because I wanted your love, not merely
your respect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. No. You didn't do
it simply because you knew that I would
refuse you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> And suppose I expected
"Yes" from you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Then you would have proposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> And married you without
your love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> But then I didn't know that
you loved another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>brokenly</i>]. The other no
longer exists for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>looks again at the floor. Silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Hindes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Come nearer to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes.</span> I am lame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny.</span> Put all your bundles aside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>hesitates for a moment, then

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>as if in embarrassment</i>].
Everything.... Everything....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindes</span> [<i>bluntly</i>]. Don't be ashamed.

<p class="salute">[<i>He lays aside the crutch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span> [<i>arises, takes his hand</i>].
Hindes, you know my attitude toward

[<i>Nestles her head against him, coyly.</i>]
Embrace me, and give me a kiss, a hot,
passionate kiss. Put into it your whole
love, make it express your whole true
soul. [<i>Brokenly, and in tears.</i>] I tell
you, our life will be&mdash;happy. We souls,
forgotten by happiness, will yet find it&mdash;in
our own way&mdash;as best we can.
[<i>Less tearfully.</i>] You'll see how it'll
soon be. Lizzie will come home and she'll
play us a march of jubilation, a march
of joy.... [<i>Brokenly.</i>] She owes it to
me!... I'll dance, I tell you; I'll dance
for two. You'll see. And I'll sing. I'll
turn things upside down. Hindes, kiss
me, hotly, hotly.</p>

<h4>FOREWORD</h4>


<p>What is wanting in this list the reader will only too soon discover for himself.
I do not, however, wish to offer a faltering apology for the incompleteness of the
work. In truth, it needs none. Nevertheless, a brief word of explanation may not
be amiss.</p>

<p>The duties of the bibliographer are more or less mechanical. He merely collects
his data from the most available sources or from arcana known only to a few,
arranges his material alphabetically and sends his copy to the printer.</p>

<p>The present list is an exception to the general practice. It will be noted
that the bibliographer has broken his traces, forsaken his accustomed field and intruded,
in some measure, upon the province of the critic. From the great mass of
plays accessible in English I have sought to select only those which I hold best
adapted to the little theater as it is to-day constituted. On the whole, they are
plays which have encountered a certain measure of success or that I felt to be
worthy of production. Rigid care has been taken to exclude such dramatic pieces
which are fittingly described as "side-splitting farces." The latter contribute nothing
to the art theater. Box and Cox, I doubt not, may be excruciatingly funny, but
few would care to hear that Sam Hume, for instance, was about to produce it.
Not that genuine laughter hasn't its place in the modern theater; but we cannot
laugh to-day at the archaic drolleries of yesterday. We cannot abandon ourselves
to papier-mach&eacute; characterization in the theater. And this is what the art theater
accomplished in its brief stay with us.</p>

<h3><i>Plays and Players</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Leaves From a Critic's Scrapbook</span></h4>

<h4>BY WALTER PRICHARD EATON<br />

PREFACE BY BARRETT H. CLARK</h4>


<p>A new volume of criticisms of plays and papers on acting,
play-making, and other dramatic problems, by Walter
Prichard Eaton, dramatic critic, and author of "The
American Stage of To-day," "At the New Theater and
Others," "Idyl of the Twin Fires," etc. The new
volume begins with plays produced as far back as 1910,
and brings the record down to the current year. One section
is devoted to American plays, one to foreign plays
acted on our stage, one to various revivals of Shakespeare.
These sections form a record of the important
activities of the American theater for the past six years,
and constitute about half of the volume. The remainder
of the book is given over to various discussions of the
actor's art, of play construction, of the new stage craft,
of new movements in our theater, such as the Washington
Square Players, and several lighter essays in the satiric
vein which characterized the author's work when he was
the dramatic critic of the <i><b>New York Sun</b></i>. Unlike most
volumes of criticisms, this one is illustrated, the pictures of
the productions described in the text furnishing an additional
historical record. At a time when the drama is
regaining its lost position of literary dignity it is particularly
fitting that dignified and intelligent criticism and
discussion should also find accompanying publication.</p>

<p><i><b>Toronto Saturday Night:</b></i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Eaton writes well and with dignity and independence.
His book should find favor with the more
serious students of the Drama of the Day.</p></div>

<p><i><b>Detroit Free Press:</b></i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is one of the most interesting and also valuable
books on the modern drama that we have
encountered in that period popularly referred to as
"a dog's age." Mr. Eaton is a competent and well-esteemed
critic. The book is a record of the activities
of the American stage since 1910, down to the
present. Mr. Eaton succinctly restores the play to
the memory, revisualizes the actors, and puts the
kernel of it into a nutshell for us to ponder over and
by which to correct our impressions.</p></div>

<h3><i>Contemporary French Dramatists</i></h3>

<h4>By BARRETT H. CLARK</h4>


<p><i>In "Contemporary French Dramatists" Mr. Barrett H.
Clark, author of "The Continental Drama of Today,"
"The British and American Drama of Today," translator
of "Four Plays of the Free Theater," and of various plays
of Donnay, Hervieu, Lemaitre, Sardou, Lavedan, etc., has
contributed the first collection of studies on the modern
French theater. Mr. Clark takes up the chief dramatists
of France beginning with the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre: Curel,
Brieux, Hervieu, Lema&icirc;tre, Lavedan, Donnay, Porto-Riche,
Rostand, Bataille, Bernstein, Capus, Flers, and Caillavet.
The book contains numerous quotations from the chief representative
plays of each dramatist, a separate chapter on
"Characteristics" and the most complete bibliography to
be found anywhere.</i></p>

<p><i>This book gives a study of contemporary drama in
France which has been more neglected than any other
European country.</i></p>

<p><b><i>Independent, New York</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Almost indispensable to the student of the theater."</p></div>

<p><b><i>Boston Transcript</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Clark's method of analyzing the works of the
Playwrights selected is simple and helpful. * * * As
a manual for reference or story, 'Contemporary French
Dramatists,' with its added bibliographical material,
will serve well its purpose."</p></div>

Henderson has a catholic spirit and writes without

that one agrees with Mr. Henderson's main contentions
and is eager to break a lance with him about
minor points, which is only a way of saying that he is

<h4><i>Author of</i> "European Dramatists," "George Bernard
Shaw&mdash;His Life and Work." Etc.</h4>


<p>A vital book, popular in style, cosmopolitan in tone,
appraising the drama of the past sixty years, its changes,
contributions and tendencies. Has an expression of the
larger realities of the art and life of our time.</p>

<p><b><i>E. E. Hale</i></b> in <i>The Dial</i>: "One of the most widely
read dramatic critics of our day; few know as well as he
what is 'up' in the dramatic world, what are the currents
of present-day thought, what people are thinking,
dreaming, doing, or trying to do."</p>

<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b>: "Apt, happily allusive, finely informed
essays on the dramatists of our own time&mdash;his
essay style is vigorous and pleasing."</p>

<p><b><i>Book News Monthly</i></b>: "Shows clear understanding
of the evolution of form and spirit, and the differentiation
of the forces&mdash;spiritual, intellectual and social&mdash;which
are making the theatre what it is today ... we
can recollect no book of recent times which has such contemporaneousness,
yet which regards the subject with such
excellent perspective ... almost indispensable to the general
student of drama ... a book of rich perspective and
sound analysis. The style is simple and direct."</p>

<p><b><i>Geo. Middleton</i></b> in <i>La Follette's</i>: "The best attempt
to formulate the tendencies which the drama is now taking

<p>This remarkable book, upon which the author has been at work for more

socialist. In order to give it the authority which any true biography of
a living man must possess, Mr. Shaw has aided the author in every possible

Shaw's works, published, uncollected in book form or unpublished, but also
on extensive data furnished the author by Mr. Shaw in person.</p>

<p>A masterly and monumental volume, it is a history of Art, Music, Literature,

<h3><i>Short Plays</i></h3>

<h4>By MARY MAC MILLAN</h4>


<p><i>To fill a long-felt want. All have been successfully
presented. Suitable for Women's Clubs, Girls' Schools,
etc. While elaborate enough for big presentation, they
may be given very simply.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Review of Reviews</b></i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mary MacMillan offers '<span class="smcap">Short Plays</span>,' a collection
of pleasant one to three-act plays for women's
clubs, girls' schools, and home parlor production.
Some are pure comedies, others gentle satires on
women's faults and foibles. 'The Futurists,' a skit
on a woman's club in the year 1882, is highly amusing.
'Entr' Act' is a charming trifle that brings two
quarreling lovers together through a ridiculous private
theatrical. 'The Ring' carries us gracefully back
to the days of Shakespeare; and 'The Shadowed Star,'
the best of the collection, is a Christmas Eve tragedy.
The Star is shadowed by our thoughtless inhumanity
to those who serve us and our forgetfulness of the
needy. The Old Woman, gone daft, who babbles in
a kind of mongrel Kiltartan, of the Shepherds, the
Blessed Babe, of the Fairies, rowan berries, roses and
dancing, while her daughter dies on Christmas Eve, is
a splendid characterization."</p></div>

<p><i><b>Boston Transcript</b></i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Those who consigned the writer of these plays to
solitude and prison fare evidently knew that 'needs
must' is a sharp stimulus to high powers. If we find
humor, gay or rich, if we find brilliant wit; if we
find constructive ability joined with dialogue which
moves like an arrow; if we find delicate and keen
characterization, with a touch of genius in the choice
of names; if we find poetic power which moves on
easy wing&mdash;the gentle jailers of the writer are justified,
and the gentle reader thanks their severity."</p></div>

<p><i><b>Salt Lake Tribune</b></i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Plays are ten in number, all of goodly length.
We prophesy great things for this gifted dramatist."</p></div>

<p><i><b>Bookseller, News Dealer &amp; Stationer</b></i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The dialogue is permeated with graceful satire,
snatches of wit, picturesque phraseology, and tender,
often exquisite, expressions of sentiment."</p></div>

<h3><i>More Short Plays</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">BY MARY MacMILLAN</span></h4>


<p>Plays that act well may read well. Miss MacMillan's
plays are good reading. Nor is literary excellence a
detriment to dramatic performance. They were put on
the stage before they were put into print. They differ
slightly from those in the former volume. Two of them,
"The Pioneers," a story of the settlement of the Ohio
Valley, and "Honey," a little mountain girl cotton-mill
worker, are longer. The other six, "In Mendelesia,"
Parts I and II, "The Dryad," "The Dress Rehearsal of
Hamlet," "At the Church," and "His Second Girl,"
contain the spirit of humor, something of subtlety, and
something of fantasy.</p>

<p><i><b>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</b></i>: "Mary MacMillan, whose
first volume of short plays proved that she possessed
unusual gifts as a dramatist, has justified the hopes
of her friends in a second volume, 'More Short Plays,'
which reveal the author as the possessor of a charming
literary style coupled with a sure dramatic sense
that never leads her idea astray.... In them all the
reader will find a rich and delicate charm, a bountiful
endowment of humor and wit, a penetrating knowledge
of human nature, and a deft touch in the drawing
of character. They are delicately and sympathetically
done and their literary charm is undeniable."</p>

<h3><i>Comedies of Words<br />

<h4>BY ARTHUR SCHNITZLER<br />

"<i><b>Great Scenes</b></i>"<br />
"<i><b>The Festival of Bacchus</b></i>"<br />
"<i><b>His Helpmate</b></i>"<br />
"<i><b>Literature</b></i>."</p>

<p>In his "Comedies of Words," Arthur Schnitzler, the
great Austrian Dramatist, has penetrated to newer and
profounder regions of human psychology. According to
Schnitzler, the keenly compelling problems of earth are:
the adjustment of a man to one woman, a woman to one
man, the children to their parents, the artist to life, the
individual to his most cherished beliefs, and how can we
accomplish this adjustment when, try as we please, there
is a destiny which sweeps our little plans away like helpless
chessmen from the board? Since the creation of Anatol,
that delightful toy philosopher, so popular in almost
every theater of the world, the great Physician-Dramatist
has pushed on both as World-Dramatist and reconnoiterer
beyond the misty frontiers of man's conscious existence.
He has attempted in an artistic way to get beneath what
Freud calls the "Psychic Censor" which edits all our
suppressed desires. Reading Schnitzler is like going to
school to Life itself!</p>

<h3>Portmanteau Plays</h3>

<h4>BY STUART WALKER<br />
<br />
Edited and with an Introduction by<br />

EDWARD HALE BIERSTADT</h4>


<p>This volume contains four One Act Plays by the inventor
and director of the Portmanteau Theater. They
are all included in the regular repertory of the Theater
and the four contained in this volume comprise in themselves
an evening's bill.</p>

<p>There is also an Introduction by Edward Hale Bierstadt
on the Portmanteau Theater in theory and practice.</p>

<p>The book is illustrated by pictures taken from actual
presentations of the plays.</p>

<p>The first play, the <i><b>"Trimplet"</b></i>, deals with the search
for a certain magic thing called a trimplet which can cure
all the ills of whoever finds it. The search and the finding
constitute the action of the piece.</p>

<p>Second play, <i><b>"Six who Pass While the Lentils
Boil"</b></i>, is perhaps the most popular in Mr. Walker's
repertory. The story is of a Queen who, having stepped
on the ring-toe of the King's great-aunt, is condemned
to die before the clock strikes twelve. The Six who pass
the pot in which boil the lentils are on their way to the
execution.</p>

<p>Next comes <i><b>"Nevertheless"</b></i>, which tells of a burglar
who oddly enough reaches regeneration through two children
and a dictionary.</p>

<p>And last of all is the <i><b>"Medicine-Show"</b></i>, which is a
character study situated on the banks of the Mississippi.
One does not see either the Show or the Mississippi, but
the characters are so all sufficient that one does not miss
the others.</p>

<p>All of these plays are fanciful&mdash;symbolic if you like&mdash;but
all of them have a very distinct raison d'&ecirc;tre in
themselves, quite apart from any ulterior meaning.</p>

<p>With Mr. Walker it is always "the story first," and
herein he is at one with Lord Dunsany and others of his
ilk. The plays have body, force, and beauty always; and
if the reader desires to read in anything else surely that
is his privilege.</p>

<p>Each play, and even the Theater itself has a prologue,
and with the help of these one is enabled to pass from one
charming tale to the next without a break in the continuity.</p>

<p>The thorough success of the volume entitled <i><b>"Portmanteau
Plays"</b></i> has encouraged the publication of a
second series under the title <i><b>"More Portmanteau
Plays"</b></i>. This continuation carries on the work begun in
the first book, and contains <i><b>"The Lady of the Weeping
Willow Tree"</b></i>, one of the finest and most effective
pieces Stuart Walker has presented under his own name;
<i><b>"The Very Naked Boy"</b></i>, a slight, whimsical, and
wholly delightful bit of foolery; <i><b>"Jonathan Makes a
Wish"</b></i>, a truly strong three-act work with an appeal of
unusual vigor.</p>

<p>The third volume of the Portmanteau Series includes
three of Stuart Walker's most successful plays
which are either adapted from or based on works by
other authors. The first is the ever wonderful <i><b>"Gammer
Gurton's Needle"</b></i>, written some hundreds of years
ago and now arranged for the use of the modern theater
goer. Next comes, <i><b>"The Birthday of the Infanta"</b></i>
from the poignant story of Oscar Wilde (used also by
Alfred Noyes in one of his most effective poems), and
last of all the widely popular <i><b>"Seventeen"</b></i> from the
story of the same name by Booth Tarkington.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
